<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>In offering to the public a revised and complete
history of the most remarkable of American frontiersmen,
we perform a pleasing task. All the attainable
circumstances connected with his life, adventures
and death are fully set forth, and we offer
this in confidence as a reliable authority for the
reader.</p>

<p>No one should hesitate to familiarize himself with
the exploits of the subject of this volume. They
evince a magnanimity and an uprightness of character
that is rarely found in one leading so daring
and intensely wild a life, and cannot but contribute
their share of lustre to the interesting records of the
Far West. We regret that his modesty, equally
proverbial with his daring, prompted him to withhold
many of the exciting incidents of his career
from the public.</p>

<p>We have compiled a portion of this work from
such official reports of his great skill, indomitable
energy, and unfaltering courage as have been communicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
by his friend and commander, Col. Fremont,
who has invariably awarded to him all the
best attributes of manhood, when opportunity afforded.
Added to these, our hero had been prevailed
upon by a few of his friends to communicate some
of the records of the most important passages in
his extraordinary and eventful life, which are embodied
in this volume.</p>

<p>His has indeed been a life of peculiarly exciting
personal hazards, bold adventures, daring coolness,
and moral and physical courage, such as has seldom
transpired in the world, and we have been greatly
impressed, in its preparation, with the necessity for a
thorough work of this kind. All are aware that the
young, and even matured, often seek for books of
wild adventure, and if those of an unhurtful and
truthful character are not found, they are apt to betake
themselves to trashy and damaging literature.
In this view, this work has a purpose which, we
trust, will commend it to every family throughout
the land.</p>

<h2>LIFE OF<br />
CHRISTOPHER CARSON.</h2>

<hr class="p4" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<p>As, for their intrepid boldness and stern
truthfulness, the exploits and deeds of the old
Danish sea-kings, have, since the age of Canute,
been justly heralded in song and story; so now
by the world-wide voice of the press, this, their
descendant, as his name proves him, is brought
before the world: and as the stern integrity of
the exploits and deeds of the old Danes in the
age of Canute were heralded by song and
story; so too, in this brief and imperfect memoir,
are those of one who by name and birthright
claims descent from them. The subject
of the present memoir, Christopher Carson, familiarly
known under the appellation of Kit
Carson, is one of the most extraordinary men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of the present era. His fame has long been established
throughout this country and Europe,
as a most skillful and intrepid hunter, trapper,
guide, and pilot of the prairies and mountains
of the far West, and Indian fighter. But
his celebrity in these characters is far surpassed
by that of his individual personal traits
of courage, coolness, fidelity, kindness, honor,
and friendship. The theatre of his exploits is
extended throughout the whole western portion
of the territory of the United States, from the
Mississippi to the Pacific, and his associates
have been some of the most distinguished men
of the present age, to all of whom he has become
an object of affectionate regard and
marked respect. The narrative which follows
will show his titles to this distinction, so far as
his modesty (for the truly brave are always
modest) has permitted the world to learn anything
of his history.</p>

<p>It appears, from the various declarations of
those most intimate with Christopher Carson,
as well as from a biography published a number
of years before his death, that he was a
native of Madison county, Kentucky, and was
born on the 24th of December, 1809. Colonel
Fremont in his exhaustive and interesting Report
of his Exploring Expedition to Oregon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and North California, in 1843-44, says that
Carson is a native of Boonslick county, Missouri;
and from his long association with the
hunter, he probably makes the statement on
Carson's own authority. The error, if it is an
error, may have arisen from the fact stated by
Mr. Peters, that Carson's father moved from
Kentucky to Missouri, when Christopher was
only one year old. He settled in what is now
Howard county, in the central part of Missouri.</p>

<p>At the time of Mr. Carson's emigration, Missouri
was called Upper Louisiana, being a part
of the territory ceded to the United States by
France in 1803, and it became a separate State,
under the name of Missouri, in 1821. When
Mr. Carson removed his family from Kentucky,
and settled in the new territory, it was a wild
region, naturally fertile, thus favoring his views
as a cultivator; abounding in wild game, and
affording a splendid field of enterprise for the
hunter, but infested on all sides with Indians,
often hostile, and always treacherous.</p>

<p>As Mr. Carson united the pursuits of farmer
and hunter, and lived in a sort of block-house
or fort, as a precaution against the attacks of
the neighboring Indians, his son became accustomed
to the presence of danger, and the necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of earnest action and industry from his
earliest childhood.</p>

<p>At the age of fifteen, Kit Carson was apprenticed
to Mr. Workman, a saddler. This
trade requiring close confinement, was, of
course, utterly distasteful to a boy already accustomed
to the use of the rifle, and the stirring
pleasures of the hunter's life, and at the
end of two years, his apprenticeship was terminated,
for Kit, who, with his experience as
the son of a noted hunter, himself perfectly familiar
with the rifle, and, young as he was,
acknowledged to be one of the best and surest
shots, even in that State, where such merit predominated
at that time over almost every other,
could not bear in patience the silent, sedentary
monotony of his life, voluntarily abandoned the
further pursuit of the trade, and sought the more
active employment of a trader's life.</p>

<p>His new pursuit was more congenial. He
joined an armed band of traders in an expedition
to Santa Fe, the capital of New Mexico.
This, at that period, (1826,) was rather a perilous
undertaking, on account of the Indian
tribes who were ever ready to attack a trading
caravan, when there was any prospect of overcoming
it. No attack was made on the party,
however, and no incident of importance occurred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
if we except the accident to one of the
teamsters who wounded himself by carelessly
handling a loaded rifle, so as to render it necessary
to amputate his arm. In this operation
Carson assisted, the surgical instruments
being a razor, an old saw, and an iron bolt,
heated red hot, in order to apply the actual
cautery. Notwithstanding this rough surgery,
the man recovered.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">A</a></p>

<p>In November (1826) the party arrived at
Santa Fe, the capital, and the largest town in
the then Mexican province of New Mexico.
This place is situated on the Rio Chiuto, or
Santa Fe river, an affluent of the Rio Grande,
from which it is distant about 20 miles. It
was then, as now, the great emporium of the
overland trade, which, since 1822, has been
carried on with the State of Missouri. The
houses are chiefly built of <i>adobes</i>, or unburnt
bricks, each dwelling forming a square, with a
court in the centre upon which the apartments
open. This mode of building, originally Moorish,
prevails in all the colonies settled by the
Spaniards, as well as in Old Spain, and the
oriental countries. It makes each house a sort
of fortress, as General Taylor's troops learned
to their cost at the siege of Monterey. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
front entrance of each house is large enough to
admit animals with their packs.</p>

<p>Santa Fe is well supplied with cool water
from springs within its limits, and from fountains
above the city near the neighbouring
mountain. The appearance of the place is inviting
and imposing, as it stands on a plateau
elevated more than 7000 feet above the sea,
and near a snow capped mountain, which rises
5000 feet above the level of the town; but the
population is said to be exceedingly depraved.
The present population is about 5000; but at
the time of Carson's first visit, it was comparatively
a small town.</p>

<p>Soon after their arrival at Santa Fe, Carson
left the trading band, which he had joined when
he abandoned the saddlery business, or trade,
as the reader may choose to term it, and of
which we have previously spoken, and proceeded
to Fernandez de Taos. In this place
Carson passed the winter of 1826-7, at the
house of a retired mountaineer. And it was
while residing there, that he acquired that thorough
familiarity with the Spanish language,
which, in after years, proved of such essential
service to him. In the spring he joined a
party bound for Missouri, but meeting another
band of Santa Fe traders, he joined them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
returned to that place. Here his services being
no longer required by the traders, he was
again thrown out of employment. He now
engaged himself as teamster to a party bound
to El Paso, a settlement, or more properly a
line of settlements, embracing a population of
about 5,000, situated in the rich, narrow valley
which extends 9 or 10 miles along the right
bank of the Rio Grande, in the Mexican State
of Chihuahua, 350 miles S. by W. of Santa Fe.
Here the grape is extensively cultivated, and
considerable quantities of light wine and brandy,
(called by the traders <i>Pass wine</i> and <i>Pass
brandy</i>,) are made. The houses are like those
of Santa Fe, built of <i>adobes</i> with earthen floors.
With abundance of natural advantages, the
people are content to live without those appliances
of civilized life, considered indispensable
by the poorest American citizens. Glazed windows,
chairs, tables, knives and forks, and similar
every day conveniences are unknown even
to the rich among the people of El Paso. The
place is the chief emporium of the trade between
New Mexico and Chihuahua, and its
name, "the passage" is derived from the passage
of the river through a gorge or gap in the
mountain just above the town.</p>

<p>On his arrival at this place, young Carson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
might justly be considered in view of his age,
(not yet 18,) more than an ordinary traveler.
He had arrived at a spot where everything was
strange to him. New people, new customs, a
new climate, a wine country, a population of
mixed breed, half Indian, half Spaniard&mdash;everything
wearing a foreign aspect; everything
totally different from his home in Missouri.</p>

<p>He did not remain long in this place, but returned
to Santa Fe, whence he again found his
way to Taos, where he passed the winter in the
service of Mr. Ewing Young, in the humble
capacity of cook; this he soon forsook for
the more pleasant and profitable position of
Spanish interpreter to a trader named Tramell,
with whom he, for the second time, made
the long journey to El Paso and Chihuahua.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p>Chihuahua, where Carson had now arrived,
is the capital of the Mexican province bearing
the same name. It is situated on a small tributary
of the Conchos river, in the midst of a
plain. It is regularly laid out and well built;
the streets are broad and some of them paved.
Like other cities built by the Spaniards, it has
its great public square, or Plaza Major, on one
side of which stands the cathedral, an imposing
edifice of hewn stone, built at a cost of
$300,000. It is surmounted with a dome and
two towers, and has a handsome façade with
statues of the twelve apostles, probably the
first statues that Carson had ever seen. Other
public buildings surround the square, and there
is a fountain in the middle. The city contains
a convent founded by the Jesuits, and an aqueduct
3-1/2 miles long, supported by vast arches
and communicating with the river Chihuahua.
It has also its mint, and in the neighborhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
are silver mines with furnaces for melting the
ore. It carries on an extensive trade with the
United States by means of caravans to St.
Louis in Missouri, and San Antonio in Texas.
It was founded in 1691, and during the time
when the silver mines were in successful operation,
it contained 70,000 inhabitants. The
population at present is 14,000.</p>

<p>As he had come with one of the trading caravans
in the service of Colonel Tramell as
Spanish interpreter, we might naturally expect
that the engagement would be a permanent
one. But such was not the case. The
monotony of this life soon disgusted him, and
after weary weeks passed in comparative idleness,
he longed again for the freedom of the
prairie and the forest, and gladly abandoning
the rather dignified position of interpreter to
Colonel Tramell, entered into the service of
Mr. Robert M. Knight, in the more humble
capacity of teamster in an expedition to the
copper mines on the river Gila, whence he
soon after found his way back to Taos.</p>

<p>It was during this visit to Taos that Carson
was first enabled to gratify the desire which he
had long entertained of becoming a regular
hunter and trapper. A party of trappers in
the service of Carson's old friend, Mr. Ewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Young, had returned to Taos, having been
beaten off from their hunting and trapping
grounds by a hostile band of Indians. Mr.
Young raised a party of forty men, for the
double purpose of chastising the Indians, and
resuming the business of trapping, and Carson
joined them. The fact that he was accepted
for this service was a marked token of esteem
for his valor, as well as his skill in hunting, parties
of this description always avoiding the enlistment
of inexperienced recruits, as likely to
embarrass their operations in the field.</p>

<p>The ostensible object of the expedition was
to punish the Indians, but its ultimate purpose
was to trap for beavers. The Mexicans by an
express law had forbidden granting licenses to
any American parties, and in this instance a
circuitous route was chosen to conceal their
real design.</p>

<p>They did not fall in with the Indians of whom
they were in pursuit, until they had reached
the head of one of the affluents of the Rio Gila,
called Salt River. Once in presence of their
enemies they made short work with them, killing
fifteen of their warriors, and putting the
whole band to rout. Such occurrences were by
no means unfrequent, as we shall see in the
course of this narrative. A small body of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
experienced hunters and trappers, confident in
their superior skill and discipline, never hesitates
to attack a greatly superior number of
Indians, and it was a rare thing that success
did not attend their daring. The Indian is not
fond of a "fair stand up fight." He prefers
stratagem and ambush, and reverences as a
great "brave," the warrior who is most successful
in circumventing his enemies, and bringing
off many scalps without the loss of a man; but
when a considerable number of Indians are
shot down in the first onset, the remainder are
very apt to take to flight in every direction.</p>

<p>We have said that Carson joined the party
of trappers under the command of Mr. Ewing
Young, and it may not be out of place to describe
briefly the mode of life which parties
in that pursuit have to adopt, with a few remarks
upon the habits and haunts of the animal,
for whose sake men were then so willing
to risk their lives, and to undergo such hardships.</p>

<p>The method of trapping for beaver formerly
employed by the trappers in the western country,
is thus described by one who has had considerable
experience in the art; and we quote it
as illustrating the severe training to which
Carson had voluntarily subjected himself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
"To be a successful trapper, required great
caution as well as a perfect knowledge of the
habits of the animal. The residence of the
beaver was often discovered by seeing bits of
green wood, and gnawed branches of the bass-wood,
slippery elm, and sycamore, their favorite
food, floating on the water, or lodged on
the shores of the stream below, as well as by
their tracks or foot-marks. These indications
were technically called <i>beaver sign</i>. They were
also sometimes discovered by their dams,
thrown across creeks and small sluggish
streams, forming a pond in which were erected
their habitations.</p>

<p>"The hunter, as he proceeded to set his traps,
generally approached by water, in his canoe.
He selected a steep, abrupt spot in the bank
of the creek, in which a hole was excavated
with his paddle, as he sat in the canoe, sufficiently
large to hold the trap, and so deep as
to be about three inches below the surface of
the water, when the jaws of the trap were expanded.
About two feet above the trap, a
stick, three or four inches in length, was stuck
in the bank. In the upper end of this, the
trapper excavated a small hole with his knife,
into which he dropped a small quantity of the
essence, or perfume, which was used to attract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the beaver to the spot. This stick was attached
by a string of horse hair to the trap, and with
it was pulled into the water by the beaver.
The reason for this was, that it might not remain
after the trap was sprung, and attract
other beavers to the spot, and thus prevent
their going to where there was another trap
ready for them.</p>

<p>"The scent, or essence, was made by mingling
the fresh castor of the beaver, with an extract
of the bark of the roots of the spice-bush, and
kept in a bottle for use. The making of this
essence was held a profound secret, and often
sold for a considerable sum to the younger
trappers, by the older proficients in the mystery
of beaver hunting. Where they had no
proper bait, they sometimes made use of the
fresh roots of sassafras, or spice-bush; of both
these the beaver was very fond.</p>

<p>"It is said by old trappers that they will
smell the well-prepared essence the distance
of a mile. Their sense of smell is very acute,
or they would not so readily detect the vicinity
of man by the smell of his trail. The
aroma of the essence having attracted the animal
into the vicinity of the trap, in his attempt
to reach it, he has to climb up on to the bank
where it is sticking. This effort leads him directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
over the trap, and he is usually taken
by one of the fore legs. The trap was connected
by a chain of iron, six feet in length, to
a stout line made of the bark of the leather-wood,
twisted into a neat cord, of fifteen or
twenty feet. These were usually prepared by
the trappers at home or at their camps, for
cords of hemp or flax were scarce in the days
of beaver hunting. The end of the line was
secured to a stake driven into the bed of the
creek under water, and in his struggles to escape,
the beaver was usually drowned before
the arrival of the trapper. Sometimes, however,
he freed himself by gnawing off his own
leg, though this was rarely the case. If there
was a prospect of rain, or it was raining at the
time of setting the trap, a leaf, generally of
sycamore, was placed over the essence stick, to
protect it from the rain.</p>

<p>"The beaver being a very sagacious and cautious
animal, it required great care in the trapper
in his approach to its haunts to set his
traps, that no scent of his feet or hands was
left on the earth, or bushes that he touched.
For this reason he generally approached in a
canoe. If he had no canoe, it was necessary
to enter the stream thirty or forty yards below,
and walk in the water to the place, taking care to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
return in the same manner, lest the beaver should
take alarm and not come near the bait, as his
fear of the vicinity of man was greater than
his sense of appetite for the essence. It also
required caution in kindling a fire near their
haunts, as the smell of smoke alarmed them.
The firing of a gun, also, often marred the
sport of the trapper, and thus it will be seen
that to make a successful beaver hunter, required
more qualities or natural gifts than fall
to the share of most men."</p>

<p>Carson's previous habits and pursuits had
eminently qualified him to become an useful
and even a distinguished member of Mr.
Young's company of trappers. He had lived
in the midst of danger from his childhood.
He was familiar with the use of arms; and
several years of travel and adventure had already
given him more knowledge of the western
wilds in the neighborhood of the region
which was the scene of their present operations,
than was possessed by many who had
seen more years than himself. Added to this,
he had become well acquainted with the peculiar
character and habits of the western Indians,
who were now prowling around their
camp, and occasionally stealing their traps,
game, and animals.</p>

<p>The party pursued their business successfully
for some time on the Salt and San Francisco
rivers, when a part of them returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
New Mexico, and the remainder, eighteen in
number, under the lead of Mr. Young, started
for the valley of Sacramento, California, and
it was to this latter party Carson was attached.
Their route led them through one of the dry
deserts of the country, and not only did they
suffer considerably from the want of water,
but their provisions giving out, they were often
happy when they could make a good dinner on
horse-flesh. Near the Cañon of the Colorado
they encountered a party of Mohave Indians,
who furnished them with some provisions,
which relieved them from the apprehension
of immediate want.</p>

<p>The Mohave Indians are thus described by a
recent visitor:</p>

<p>"These Indians are probably in as wild a
state of nature as any tribe on American territory.
They have not had sufficient intercourse
with any civilized people, to acquire a knowledge
of their language, or their vices. It was
said that no white party had ever before passed
through their country without encountering
hostility; nevertheless they appear intelligent,
and to have naturally amiable dispositions.
The men are tall, erect, and well-proportioned;
their features inclined to European
regularity; their eyes large, shaded by long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
lashes, and surrounded by circles of blue pigment,
that add to their apparent size. The
apron, or breech-cloth for men, and a short
petticoat, made of strips of the inner bark of
the cotton-wood, for women, are the only articles
of dress deemed indispensable; but many
of the females have long robes, or cloaks, of
fur. The young girls wear beads; but when
married, their chins are tattooed with vertical
blue lines, and they wear a necklace with a
single sea-shell in front, curiously wrought.
These shells are very ancient, and esteemed of
great value.</p>

<p>"From time to time they rode into the
camp, mounted on spirited horses; their bodies
and limbs painted and oiled, so as to present
the appearance of highly-polished mahogany.
The dandies paint their faces perfectly black.
Warriors add a streak of red across the forehead,
nose, and chin. Their ornaments consist
of leathern bracelets, adorned with bright buttons,
and worn on the left arm; a kind of
tunic, made of buckskin fringe, hanging from
the shoulders; beautiful eagles' feathers, called
'sormeh'&mdash;sometimes white, sometimes of a
crimson tint&mdash;tied to a lock of hair, and floating
from the top of the head; and, finally,
strings of wampum, made of circular pieces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
shell, with holes in the centre, by which they
are strung, often to the length of several yards,
and worn in coils about the neck. These shell
beads, which they call 'pook,' are their substitute
for money, and the wealth of an individual
is estimated by the 'pook' cash he
possesses."</p>

<p>Soon after leaving the Mohave Indians, Mr.
Young's party, proceeding westward, arrived at
the Mission of San Gabriel. This is one of
these extensive establishments formed by the
Roman Catholic clergy in the early times of
California, which form so striking a feature in
the country. This Mission of San Gabriel,
about the time of Carson's visit, was in a flourishing
condition. By statistical accounts, in
1829, it had 70,000 head of cattle, 1,200 horses,
3,000 mares, 400 mules, 120 yoke of working
cattle, and 254,000 sheep. From the vineyards
of the mission were made 600 barrels of wine,
the sale of which produced an income of upwards
of $12,000. There were between twenty
and thirty such missions in California at that
time, of which San Gabriel was by no means
the largest. They had all been founded since
1769, when the first, San Diego, was established.
The labor in these establishments was performed
by Indian converts, who received in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
return a bare support, and a very small modicum
of what was called religious instruction.
Each mission had its Catholic priests, a few
Spanish or Mexican soldiers, and hundreds,
sometimes thousands of Indians.</p>

<p>The following interesting account of those of
Upper California, we transcribe from a recent
work of high authority.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">B</a></p>

<p>"The missions of Upper California were indebted
for their beginning and chief success to
the subscriptions which, as in the case of the
missionary settlements of the lower province,
were largely bestowed by the pious to promote
so grand a work as turning a great country to
the worship of the true God. Such subscriptions
continued for a long period, both in Old
and New Spain, and were regularly remitted
to the City of Mexico, where they were formed
into what was called '<i>The Pious Fund of California</i>.'
This fund was managed by the convent
of San Fernando and other trustees in
Mexico, and the proceeds, together with the
annual salaries allowed by the Crown to the
missionaries, were transmitted to California.
Meanwhile, the Spanish court scarcely interfered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
with the temporal government of the country.
It was true that some of the ordinary civil offices
and establishments were kept up; but this
was only in name, and on too small a scale to
be of any practical importance. A commandante-general
was appointed by the Crown to
command the garrisons of the presidios; but as
these were originally established solely to protect
the missions from the dreaded violence of
hostile Indians, and to lend them, when necessary,
the carnal arm of offence, he was not allowed
to interfere in the temporal rule of the
Fathers. He resided at Monterey, and his
annual salary was four thousand dollars.</p>

<p>"In every sense of the word, then, these
monks were practically the sovereign rulers of
California&mdash;passing laws affecting not only
property, but even life and death&mdash;declaring
peace and war against their Indian neighbors&mdash;regulating,
receiving, and spending the finances
at discretion&mdash;and, in addition, drawing
large annual subsidies not only from the pious
among the faithful over all Christendom, but
even from the Spanish monarchy itself, almost
as a tribute to their being a superior state.
This surely was the golden age of the missions&mdash;a
contented, peaceful, believing people, abundant
wealth for all their wants, despotic will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and no responsibility but to their own consciences
and heaven! Their horn was filled
to overflowing; but soon an invisible and merciless
hand seized it, and slowly and lingeringly,
as if in malicious sport, turned it over,
and spilled the nectar of their life upon the
wastes of mankind, from whence it can never
again be collected. The golden age of another
race has now dawned, and with it the real
prosperity of the country.</p>

<p>"The missions were originally formed on
the same general plan, and they were planted
at such distances from each other as to allow
abundant room for subsequent development.
They were either established on the sea-coast,
or a few miles inland. Twenty or thirty miles
indeed seems all the distance the missionaries
had proceeded into the interior; beyond which
narrow belt the country was unexplored and
unknown. Each mission had a considerable
piece of the best land in the neighborhood set
aside for its agricultural and pastoral purposes,
which was commonly about fifteen miles square.
But besides this selected territory, there was
generally much more vacant land lying between
the boundaries of the missions, and
which, as the increase of their stocks required
more space for grazing, was gradually occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
by the flocks and herds of the Fathers, nearest
to whose mission lay the previously unoccupied
district. Over these bounds the Fathers
conducted all the operations of a gigantic farm.
Their cattle generally numbered from ten
thousand to twenty thousand and their sheep
were nearly as numerous&mdash;though some missions
had upwards of thrice these numbers&mdash;which
fed over perhaps a hundred thousand
acres of fertile land.</p>

<p>"Near the centre of such farms were placed
the mission buildings. These consisted of the
church&mdash;which was either built of stone, if that
material could be procured in the vicinity, or
of <i>adobes</i>, which are bricks dried in the sun;
and was as substantial, large, and richly decorated
an erection as the means of the mission
would permit, or the skill and strength of their
servants could construct. In the interior, pictures
and hangings decorated the walls; while
the altars were ornamented with marble pillars
of various colors, and upon and near them
stood various articles of massy gold and silver
plate. A profusion of gilding and tawdry
sparkling objects caught and pleased the eye
of the simple congregations. Around, or beside
the church, and often in the form of a
square, were grouped the habitations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Fathers and their household servants, and the
various granaries and workshops of the people;
while, at the distance of one or two hundred
yards, stood the huts of the Indians. The
former buildings were constructed of <i>adobes</i>,
and covered with brick tiles, frail and miserable
materials at the best. The huts of the Indians
were occasionally made of the same
materials, but more commonly were formed
only of a few rough poles, stuck in the ground,
with the points bending towards the centre
like a cone, and were covered with reeds and
grass. An <i>adobe</i> wall of considerable height
sometimes inclosed the whole village. The
direction of the affairs of the settlement was in
the hands of one of the Fathers, originally
called a president, but afterwards a <i>prefect</i>;
and each prefect was independent in his own
mission, and practically supreme in all its temporal,
and nearly in all its spiritual matters,
to any human authority.</p>

<p>"Thus the Fathers might be considered to
have lived something in the style of the patriarchs
of the days of Job and Abraham. They
indeed were generally ignorant and unlettered
men, knowing little more than the mechanical
rites of their church, and what else their manuals
of devotion and the treasuries of the lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of the saints taught them; but they seem to
have been personally devout, self-denying, and
beneficent in their own simple way. They
thought they did God service, and perhaps
much more the Indians themselves, in catching,
taming, and converting them to Christianity.
That was their vocation in the world, and
they faithfully obeyed its calls of duty. Towards
the converts and actually domesticated
servants, they always showed such an affectionate
kindness as a father pays to the youngest
and most helpless of his family. The
herds and flocks of the Fathers roamed undisturbed
over numberless hills and valleys.
Their servants or slaves were true born children
of the house, who laboured lightly and
pleasantly, and had no sense of freedom nor
desire for change. A rude but bounteous hospitality
marked the master's reception of the
solitary wayfarer, as he traveled from mission
to mission, perhaps bearing some scanty news
from the outer world, all the more welcome
that the Fathers knew little of the subject, and
could not be affected by the events and dangers
of distant societies. All these things
have now passed away. The churches have
fallen into decay, deserted by the old worshipers,
and poverty-stricken; the <i>adobe</i> houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of the Fathers are in ruins&mdash;and there is
scarcely any trace left of the slightly erected
huts of the Indians, who themselves have deserted
their old hearths and altars, and are
silently, though rapidly, disappearing from the
land. But the memory of the patriarchal
times, for they were only as yesterday, still
remains fresh in the minds of the early white
settlers."</p>

<p>Mr. Young's party did not remain long to
enjoy the sumptuous fare at the Mission of San
Gabriel; but pushed on to that of San Fernando,
and thence to the river and fertile valley
of Sacramento. In this neighborhood they
trapped for beaver, and Carson displayed his
activity and skill as a hunter of deer, elk, and
antelope.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<p>Only familiarity with one of like character,
by actually seeing it, can give a just idea of the
country through which they were traveling.
Livingston's descriptions of localities in Central
Africa might be transferred to our pages
<i>verbatim</i>, to give a word-painting of the desiccated
deserts of what is now New Mexico and Arizona.
Carson's curiosity, as well as care to preserve
the knowledge for future use, led him to
note in memory, every feature of the wild landscape,
its mountain chains, its desert prairies,
with only clumps of the poor artemisia for vegetation,
its rivers, and the oases upon their
banks, where there were bottom-lands&mdash;nor
were beaver found elsewhere&mdash;with its river
beds whose streams had found a passage beneath
the surface of the earth, and each other
general feature that would attract the eye of
the natural, rather than the scientific observer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
In our day, the note book of the pioneer
furnishing the data, the traveler carries a
guide-book to direct his course from point to
point, upon a well trodden road, to those
places where grass and water will furnish refreshment
for his animals, while he regales
himself, not upon the spare-rib of a starved
mule, killed because it could go no longer, but
upon a variety of good things from the well
stocked larder of the pouches of the saddle-bags
his pack mule carries, or the provision
box of his wagon. Or, instead of the meat-diet
of the trapper, when he has been in luck in a
fertile locality, the traveler&mdash;not trapper&mdash;of
to-day, perhaps has shot a prairie chicken, and
prepares his dinner by making a stew of it,
which he consumes with hard bread he has
purchased at a station not ten miles away.</p>

<p>Familiarity with the features of the country
does not restore the experience of the pioneer
of these wilds. The Indian, now, is advised by
authority he seldom dares defy, to keep off the
roads of the emigrants; and seldom does a
party leave the road for any great distance;
nor are these roads infrequent, but the country
is intersected with them, and the guide-books
protect against mistake in taking the wrong direction.
The test of character, however, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the trappers, was their ability to endure hardships
when they had to be encountered; and
to guard against them, when they could be
avoided, by a wise foresight in taking advantage
of every favor of fortune, and turning
each freak or whim of the wily dame to best
account.</p>

<p>Carson was delighted with California from
the first, and realizing intense satisfaction in
his position, yet a youth, on terms of easy familiarity
with the other seventeen old trappers,
especially selected for this expedition, circumstances
conspired to call into play all the activities
of his nature, and nothing intruded to
prevent his resigning himself to the impulses
of the time, and making the most of every occasion
that offered.</p>

<p>He had the confidence of Capt. Young and
of all his men, who permitted him to do precisely
as he chose, for they found him not only
intending always to do what was best, but possessed
of foresight to know always "just the
things that ought to be done," almost without
effort, as it seemed to them.</p>

<p>After leaving the Mission of San Fernando,
Young's party trapped upon the San Joaquim,
but they found that another party of trappers
had been there before them, employed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Hudson Bay Company, in Oregon. There was
however, room for them both, and they trapped
near each other for weeks. The friendly intercourse
kept up between the two parties, was
not only one of pleasant interchange of social
kindness, but in one sense was essentially useful
to Kit, who lost no opportunity of improving
himself in the profession (for in those days
trapping was a profession) which he had embraced,
and he had the benefit of the experience
by way of example, not only of his own
companions, but of those who were connected
with the greatest and most influential company
then in existence on this Continent. It is
hardly necessary to say that he lost no opportunity
of acquiring information, and it is quite
probable that he would, if called on, allow that
the experience acquired on this expedition was
among the most valuable of any which he had
previously gained.</p>

<p>When Mr. Young went to the Sacramento,
he separated from the Hudson Bay party.
The beautiful Sacramento, as its waters glided
toward the chain of bays that take it to the
ocean through the Bay of San Francisco out
at the Golden gate, had not the aspect of the
eastern river's immediate tributaries of the
Missouri. Its waters then were clear as crystal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and the salmon floated beneath, glistening in
the sunlight, as the canoe glided through them.</p>

<p>The very air of this valley is luxurious; and
in speaking of it, we will include the valley of
the San Joaquim, for both these streams run parallel
with the coast, the Sacramento from the
north, the San Joaquim from the south, and
both unite at the head of the chain of bays
which pour their waters into the Pacific.</p>

<p>The Sacramento drains nearly three hundred
miles of latitude, and the San Joaquim an
hundred and fifty miles of the country bounded
by the Sierra Nevada (snow mountains) on
the east, and the coast range on the west, the
whole forming a great basin, with the mountains
depressed on the north and south, but
with no outlet except through the Golden gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p>No climate could be more congenial to a
full flow of animal spirits, than this region,
where, upon the vegetation of the rich black
soil&mdash;often twenty feet deep&mdash;game of the
better class in great abundance found support.
Deer in no part of the world was ever more
plenty, and elk and antelope bounded through
the old oak groves, as they may have done in
Eden.</p>

<p>Carson had many opportunities of exploring
the country, which he gladly embraced, and
thus became familiar with many localities, the
knowledge of which was in after years of such
essential service to him and others.</p>

<p>There were many large tribes of Indians
scattered through this country, in these and
smaller valleys, beside those which the missions
had attached to them. We know not
that any record has been kept of the names of
these tribes and their numbers; but since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
white men intruded, they have melted away as
did earlier those east of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>These Indians were all of the variety called
Diggers, but in better condition than we see
them, since the small remnants of large tribes
have adopted the vices of the white men, and
learned improvidence, by sometimes having
plenty without much toil; so that they can
say to-day, "No deer, no acorn; white man
come! poor Indian hungry," as the happiest
style of begging.</p>

<p>A brief description of the Tlamath or Digger
Indians, and their mode of living, may not
now be out of place, and having been visited
by Carson in his earlier years, may not be uninteresting.
We quote from the language of
one who has paid a recent visit to the tribe:</p>

<p>"There were a dozen wigwams for the nearly
hundred that composed the tribe, one of which
was much larger than the rest, and in the centre
of the group, the temple, or "medicine lodge."
As we entered, the bones of game consumed,
and other offal lay about; and to our inquiry
why they did not clear away and be more tidy,
only a grunt was returned. The men had
gone fishing, said the Indian woman we addressed,
so we saw but two or three; but in
one wigwam which we entered there were fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
with ourselves&mdash;the rest, besides the boy
who went before to announce us, were women
and children.</p>

<p>"We ascended a mound of earth, as it
seemed, about six feet high, and through a circular
hole, perhaps two feet and a half in diameter,
descended a perpendicular ladder about
ten feet. This opening, through which we entered,
performed the double office of door and
window to the space below, which was circular,
about fourteen feet across, with arrangements
for sleeping, like berths in a steamboat,
one over another, on two sides, suspended by
tying with bark a rough stick to upright posts,
which served to hold the sticks that sustained
the roof. The whole was substantially built,
the covering being the earth which was taken
from the spot beneath, heaped upon a layer of
rushes, the floor of the wigwam being four
feet below the surface of the ground. On the two
sides of the wigwam not occupied by the berths,
were barrels filled with fish&mdash;dried salmon,
seeds, acorns, and roots.</p>

<p>"On hooks from the rush lined ceiling hung
bags and baskets, containing such luxuries as
dried grasshoppers and berries. About the
berths hung deer skins and some skins of other
game, seemingly prepared for wear. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
was no appearance of other dress, yet in the
berths sat three women, braiding strips of deer
skin, and attaching the braids to a string, in
the form of long fringe. Each of the women
wore an apron of this kind about the waist,
and only the dress of nature beside. The
children were dressed '<i>in puris naturalibus</i>.'</p>

<p>"After stopping ten minutes, we were glad to
ascend to the open air, for a sickness came over
us from which we did not recover for several
hours. How human beings live in such an atmosphere
we cannot tell, but this is the way
they habitate.</p>

<p>"When the grasshoppers were abundant, for
this insect is one of the luxuries of the Diggers,
they scoured the valley, gathering them in immense
quantities. This is done by first digging
holes or pits in the ground at the spot
chosen. Then the whole party of Indians,
each with the leafy branch of a tree, form a
circle about it and drive in the grasshoppers
till they heap them upon each other in the
pits: water is then poured in to drown them.
Their booty gathered, they proceed to another
place and perform the same operation. These
insects are prepared for food by kindling a fire
in one of these pits, and when it is heated, filling
it with them and covering it with a heated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
stone, where they are left to bake. They are
now ready for use at any time, and eaten with
gusto, or they are powdered, and mixed with
the acorn meal in a kind of bread, which is
baked in the ashes."</p>

<p>To return to the camp of trappers, and witness
one day's duties, may be gratifying to the
reader. With early dawn the traps are visited,
and the beaver secured. The traps are re-adjusted,
and the game brought into camp&mdash;or
left to be skinned where it is if the camp is far
away. Meantime breakfast has been prepared
by one of the party; others have looked after
the animals, relieving the watch which is still
kept up lest a stampede occur while all are
sleeping. Carson could not be cook for the
party constantly, but takes his turn with the
rest, and by the nice browning of his steak,
and the delicacy of his acorn coffee, and the addition
to their meal of roasted kamas root, he
proves the value of the apprenticeship of his
earlier years. He has a dish of berries, too,
and surprises the party with this tempting
dessert, as well as with the information that
in his rambles the day before he had dined
with an old Californian, with his wife and
daughters, and had the promise from them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of a cow, if he would call for it on the morrow.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, and the remains put by for
lunch at noon, Carson mounts his pony, and
riding a few miles down the bank swims the
river, and dashing out among the hills with a
high round mountain peak in view, still miles
away, is lost among the oak groves for a score
of miles, and at length emerges on Susan bay,
and doffs his hat and makes his bow to the
young Señorita who greets him at the door with
a smile of welcome. The sun is low; dinner
waits&mdash;hot bread, and butter, and cheese, and
coffee with sugar, are added to the venison
and beef, and Irish and sweet potatoes. Amid
the civilities and pleasant chat, the hour passes
happily, and Carson proposes returning to his
party.</p>

<p>The ladies will not allow him to depart.
Will he not accept the hospitality of their
mansion for a single night? They do not urge
after one refusal, because his every feature indicates
the decision of his character. He must
go. His horse is brought&mdash;a young and beautiful
animal&mdash;and the cow, this object of his
second journey thither, given him in charge as
he mounts, with a rope attached to her horns,
by which to lead her. The full moon is rising,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
on which he had calculated, as he told his hostesses,
and with words of pleasant compliment,
with which the Spanish language so much more
than ours abounds, and a <i>Buenos noches, señor</i>,
from his entertainers, and <i>Buenos noches, señoritas</i>,
in return, he slowly winds his silent way
on and on through the oak groves and the
wild oats covering the hill-sides, hearing only
the song of the owl and the whippoorwill, the
music of the insects, and the whispering leaves,
but with ear ever open to detect the stealthy
tread of the monster of the wood and hills&mdash;the
grizzly bear. Off on the distant hill he sees one,
with a cub following her; but game is plenty,
and deer is good enough food for her. On, on he
goes at slow pace, for he has a delicate charge,
and already is she restive from very weariness,
though his pace is slow.</p>

<p>Half his journey is completed as the gray
of dawn and the twinkle of the star of morning
relieves the tedium and anxiety of his loneliness.
He has made the circuit of the bay.
The river is before him as he descends the hill
which he has ascended for observation. Morning
broadens. The flowers glow with variegated
beauty as he tramples them, and in some
patches the odor of the crushed dewy beauties
fills the air to satiety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
A few miles more of travel and he crosses
the river, and is again in the river-bottom
where the party have taken the beaver. He
stops at an Indian village, and dines from the
liberal haunch and the acorn bread the chief
presents, and with good feelings displayed on
either side, takes in his arms a young papoose,
the digger's picaninny, and salutes it with a
kiss. Kit leaves there a trifling, but to them,
valuable memorial of his visit, mounts his sorrel
which is restive under the slow gait to
which he has restrained him, takes the rope
again which secures his treasure, the cow, and
plods towards home at evening. The camp fire
smokes in the distance, while the few horses
that remain are staked about, and the sentinel
paces up and down to keep off the drowsiness
induced by fatigue and a hearty meat supper.
The eastern and the western horizon are
lighted with pale silver by the departing god of
day, and the approaching goddess of the night,
and the still river divides the plain, bounded
only by the horizon, except he look behind
him. Such is the scene as, approaching, the
sentinel raises his gun and gives the challenge
to halt. But the rest of the camp
are not yet sleeping, and a dozen voices shout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
in the still evening a glad welcome to Carson,
for whom they were not concerned,
for they well knew there was not one of
the party so well able to take care of himself
as he.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p>Peters, in his "Life of Carson," tells the
story of two expeditions which Carson led
against the Indians, while they trapped upon
the Sacramento, which give proof of his courage,
and thorough education in the art of Indian
warfare, which had become a necessity to
the <i>voyageur</i> on the plains, and in the mountains
of the western wilds. With his quick
discrimination of character, and familiarity
with the habits of the race, he could not but
know the diggers were less bold than the
Apaches and Camanches, with whom he was
before familiar.</p>

<p>The Indians at the Mission San Gabriel,
were restive under coerced labor, and forty of
them made their escape to a tribe not far away.</p>

<p>The mission demanded the return of these
fugitives, and being refused, gave battle to the
neighboring tribe, but were defeated. The Padre
sent to the trappers for assistance to compel the
Indians not to harbor their people. Carson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and eleven of his companions volunteered to
aid the mission, and the attack upon the Indian
village resulted in the destruction of a
third of its inhabitants, and compelled them
to submission. Capt. Young found at this
mission a trader to take his furs, and from
them purchased a drove of horses. Directly
after his return, a party of Indians contrived
to drive away sixty horses from the trappers,
while the sentinel slept at night. Carson with
twelve men were sent in pursuit. It was not
difficult to follow the fresh trail of so large a
drove, yet he pursued them a hundred miles,
and into the mountains, before coming up with
them. The Indians supposed themselves too
far away to be followed, and were feasting on
the flesh of the stolen horses they had slaughtered.
Carson's party arranged themselves
silently and without being seen, and rushing
upon the Indian camp, killed eight men, and
scattered the remainder in every direction.
The horses were recovered, except the six
killed, and partly consumed, and with three
Indian children left in camp, they returned to
the joyful greetings of their friends.</p>

<p>Early in the autumn of 1829, Mr. Young
and his party of trappers set out on their return
home. On their route they visited Los<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Angelos, formerly called Pueblo de los Angelos,
"the city of the angels," a name which
it received on account of the exceedingly genial
climate, and the beauty of the surrounding
country. It is situated on a small river of the
same name, 30 miles from its mouth, and on
the road between the cities of San Jose and
San Diego. It is about three hundred and
fifty miles east of San Francisco, and a hundred
miles to the south.</p>

<p>Although to very many thousands of readers,
anything on the subject of the climate of California
may seem superfluous, yet there are as
many thousands who have no really distinct
idea of the country or the climate, and we
therefore quote from Rev. Dr. Bushnell, whose
article on those topics in the "New Englander,"
in 1858, attracted justly such universal
attention:</p>

<p>"The first and most difficult thing to apprehend
respecting California is the climate, upon
which, of course, depend the advantages of
health and physical development, the growths
and their conditions and kinds, and the <i>modus
operandi</i>, or general cast, of the seasons. But
this, again, is scarcely possible, without dismissing,
first of all, the word <i>climate</i>, and substituting
the plural, climates. For it cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
said of California, as of New England, or the
Middle States, that it has a climate. On the
contrary, it has a great multitude, curiously
pitched together, at short distances, one from
another, defying too, not seldom, our most accepted
notions of the effects of latitude and altitude
and the defences of mountain ranges.
The only way, therefore, is to dismiss generalities,
cease to look for a climate, and find, if we
can, by what process the combinations and varieties
are made; for when we get hold of the
manner and going on of causes, all the varieties
are easily reducible.</p>

<p>"To make this matter intelligible, conceive
that Middle California, the region of which we
now speak, lying between the head waters of
the two great rivers, and about four hundred
and fifty or five hundred miles long from
north to south, is divided lengthwise, parallel
to the coast, into three strips, or ribands of
about equal width. First, the coast-wise region,
comprising two, three, and sometimes
four parallel tiers of mountains from five hundred
to four thousand, five thousand, or even
ten thousand feet high. Next, advancing inward,
we have a middle strip, from fifty to seventy
miles wide, of almost dead plain, which is
called the great valley; down the scarcely perceptible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
slopes of which, from north to south,
and south to north, run the two great rivers,
the Sacramento and the San Joaquim, to join
their waters at the middle of the basin and
pass off to the sea. The third long strip, or
riband, is the slope of the Sierra Nevada chain,
which bounds the great valley on the east, and
contains in its foot-hills, or rather in its lower
half, all the gold mines. The upper half is, to
a great extent, bare granite rock, and is crowned
at the summit, with snow, about eight months
of the year.</p>

<p>"Now the climate of these parallel strips
will be different almost of course, and subordinate,
local differences, quite as remarkable, will
result from subordinate features in the local
configurations, particularly of the seaward strip
or portion. For all the varieties of climate,
distinct as they become, are made by variations
wrought in the rates of motion, the courses,
the temperature, and the dryness of a single
wind; viz., the trade wind of the summer
months, which blows directly inward all the
time, only with much greater power during
that part of the day when the rarefaction of
the great central valley comes to its aid; that
is, from about ten o'clock in the morning, to the
setting of the sun. Conceive such a wind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
chilled by the cold waters that have come down
from the Northern Pacific, perhaps from Behring's
Straits, combing the tops and wheeling
round through the valleys of the coastwise
mountains, crossing the great valley at a much
retarded rate, and growing hot and dry, fanning
gently the foot-hills and sides of the Sierra,
still more retarded by the piling necessary to
break over into Utah, and the conditions of
the California climate, or climates, will be understood
with general accuracy. Greater simplicity
in the matter of climate is impossible,
and greater variety is hardly to be imagined.</p>

<p>"For the whole dry season, viz., from May
to November, this wind is in regular blast,
day by day, only sometimes approaching a little
more nearly to a tempest than at others.
It never brings a drop of rain, however thick
and rain-like the clouds it sometimes drives before
it. The cloud element, indeed, is always
in it. Sometimes it is floated above, in the
manner commonly designated by the term
<i>cloud</i>. Sometimes, as in the early morning,
when the wind is most quiet, it may be seen as
a kind of fog bank resting on the sea-wall
mountains or rolling down landward through
the interstices of their summits. When the
wind begins to hurry and take on less composedly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the fog becomes blown fog, a kind of lead
dust driven through the air, reducing it from a
transparent to a semi-transparent or merely
translucent state, so that if any one looks up
the bay, from a point twenty or thirty miles
south of San Francisco, in the afternoon, he
will commonly see, directly abreast of the
Golden Gate where this wind drives in with its
greatest power, a pencil of the lead dust shooting
upwards at an angle of thirty or forty degrees,
(which is the aim of the wind preparing
to leap the second chain of mountains, the
other side of the bay,) and finally tapering off
and vanishing, at a mid-air point eight or ten
miles inland, where the increased heat of the
atmosphere has taken up the moisture, and restored
its complete transparency. This wind
is so cold, that one who will sit upon the deck
of the afternoon steamer passing up the bay,
will even require his heaviest winter clothing.
And so rough are the waters of the bay, landlocked
and narrow as it is, that sea-sickness is a
kind of regular experience, with such as are
candidates for that kind of felicity.</p>

<p>"We return now to the middle strip of the
great valley where the engine, or rather boiler
power, that operates the coast wind in a great
part of its velocity, is located. Here the heat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
reverberated as in a forge, or oven (whence
<i>Cali&mdash;fornia</i>) becomes, even in the early spring,
so much raised that the ground is no longer
able, by any remaining cold there is in it, to
condense the clouds, and rain ceases. A little
further on in the season, there is not cooling influence
enough left to allow even the phenomena
of cloud, and for weeks together, not a
cloud will be seen, unless, by chance, the skirt
of one may just appear now and then, hanging
over the summit of the western mountains.
The sun rises, fixing his hot stare on the world,
and stares through the day. Then he returns
as in an orrery, and stares through another, in
exactly the same way. The thermometer will
go up, not seldom, to 100° or even 110°, and
judging by what we know of effects here in
New England, we should suppose that life
would scarcely be supportable. And yet there
is much less suffering from heat in this valley
than with us, for the reason probably that the
nights are uniformly cool. The thermometer
goes down regularly with the sun, and one or
two blankets are wanted for the comfort of the
night. This cooling of the night is probably
determined by the fact that the cool sea wind,
sweeping through the upper air of the valley,
from the coast mountains on one side, over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
mountains and mountain passes of the Sierra
on the other, is not able to get down to the
ground of the valley during the day, because
of the powerfully steaming column of heat that
rises from it; but as soon as the sun goes down,
it drops immediately to the level of the plain,
bathing it for the night with a kind of perpendicular
sea breeze, that has lost for the time a
great part of its lateral motion. The consequence
is that no one is greatly debilitated by
the heat. On the contrary, it is the general
testimony, that a man can do as much of mental
or bodily labor in this climate, as in any
other. And it is a good confirmation of this
opinion, that horses will here maintain a wonderful
energy, traveling greater distances, complaining
far less of heat, and sustaining their
spirit a great deal better than with us. It is
also to be noted that there is no special tendency
to fevers in this hot region, except in
what is called the <i>tule</i> bottom, a kind of giant
bulrush region, along the most depressed and
marshiest portions of the rivers.</p>

<p>"Passing now to the eastern strip or portion,
the slope of the Nevada, the heat, except in
those deep cañons where the reverberation
makes it sometimes even insupportable, is
qualified in degree, according to the altitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
A gentle west wind, warmer in the lower parts
or foothills by the heat of the valley, fans it all
day. At points which are higher, the wind is
cooler; but here also, on the slope of the Nevada,
the nights are always cool in summer, so cool
that the late and early frosts leave too short a
space for the ordinary summer crop to mature,
even where the altitude is not more than 3,000
or 4,000 feet. Meantime, at the top of the
Sierra, where the west wind, piling up from
below, breaks over into Utah, travelers undertake
to say that in some of the passes it blows
with such stress as even to polish the rocks, by
the gravel and sand which it drives before it.
The day is cloudless on the slope of the Sierra,
as in the valley; but on the top there is now
and then, or once in a year or two, a moderate
thunder shower. With this exception, as referring
to a part uninhabitable, thunder is
scarcely ever heard in California. The principal
thunders of California are underground.</p>

<p>"We return now to the coast-wise mountain
region, where the multiplicity and confusion
of climates is most remarkable. Their variety
we shall find depends on the courses of the
wind currents, turned hither and thither by
the mountains; partly also on the side any
given place occupies of its valley or mountain;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and partly on the proximity of the sea.
Sprinkled in among these mountains, and
more or less inclosed by them, are valleys,
large and small, of the highest beauty. But
a valley in California means something more
than a scoop, or depression. It means a rich
land-lake, leveled between the mountains, with
a sharply defined, picturesque shore, where it
meets the sides and runs into the indentations
of the mountains. What is called the Bay of
San Francisco, is a large salt water lake in the
middle of a much larger land-lake, sometimes
called the San Jose valley. It extends south
of the city forty miles, and northward among
islands and mountains, about twenty-five more,
if we include what is called San Pueblo Bay.
Three beautiful valleys of agricultural country,
the Petaluma, Sonora, and Napa valleys, open
into this larger valley of the bay, on the north
end of it, between four mountain barriers,
having each a short navigable creek or inlet.
Still farther north is the Russian River valley,
opening towards the sea, and the Clear
Lake valley and region, which is the Switzerland
of California. East of the San Jose valley,
too, at the foot of Diabola, and up among
the mountains, are the large Amador and San
Ramon valleys, also the little gem of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Suñole. Now these valleys, which, if we except
the great valley of the two rivers, comprise
the plow-land of Middle California, have
each a climate of its own, and productions that
correspond. We have only to observe further,
that the east side of any valley will commonly
be much warmer than the west; for the very
paradoxical reason that the cold coast-wind
always blows much harder on the side or steep
slope even, of a mountain, opposite or away
from the wind, than it does on the side towards
it, reversing all our notions of the sheltering
effects of mountain ridges."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p>During this brief tarry at Los Angelos, Carson
had not been idle, but entirely without
thought that his confidence could be deemed
presumption, arranging his dress with as much
care as its character permitted, early in the
morning he mounted his horse&mdash;always in excellent
trim&mdash;and rode to the residence of the
man he had been informed owned the best <i>ranche</i>
in the vicinity, and dismounting at the wicket
gate, entered the yard, which was fenced with
a finely arranged growth of club cactus; and
passing up the gravel walk several rods, between
an avenue of fig trees, with an occasional
patch of green shrubs, and a few flowers, he
stood at the door of the spacious old Spanish
mansion, which was built of <i>adobe</i> one story in
height and nearly a hundred feet in length, its
roof covered with asphaltum mingled with sand&mdash;like
all the houses in Los Angelos, a spring
of this material existing a little way from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
town. After waiting a few moments for an
answer to his summons, made with the huge
brass knocker, an Indian servant made his appearance,
and ushered him to an elegantly furnished
room, with several guitars lying about as
if recently in use. The lordly owner of the
ranche soon appeared in morning gown and slippers,
the picture of a well to do old time gentleman,
with an air evincing an acquaintance
with the world of letters and of art, such as
only travel can produce.</p>

<p>He asked the name of his stranger guest, as
Carson approaching addressed him, and at
once commenced a conversation in English,
saying with a look of satisfied pleasure, "I address
you in your native tongue, which I presume
is agreeable, though you speak very good
Spanish;" to which Carson, much more surprised
to hear his native language so fluently
spoken, than his host was to be addressed in
Spanish, replied,</p>

<p>"It is certainly agreeable to find you can
give me the information which, as an American,
I seek, in the language my mother taught
me," and at once they were on terms of easy
familiarity.</p>

<p>As it was early morning, his host asked
Carson to take a cup of coffee with him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
conducting him to the breakfast room, presented
him to the family&mdash;a wife and several
grown sons and daughters.</p>

<p>Carson enjoyed the social part of this treat,
more than the tempting viands with which the
board was loaded. Though Spanish was the
language most used by the family, all spoke
English, and a young man from Massachusetts
was with them as a tutor to some of the
younger children. Breakfast over, the host
invited him to visit the vineyard, which he
said was hardly in condition to be exhibited,
as the picking had commenced two weeks before.
He said his yard, of a thousand varas,
yielded him more grapes than he could manage
to dispose of, though last year he had
made several butts of wine, and dried five thousand
pounds of raisins. The vines were in the
form of little trees, so closely had they been
trimmed, and were still loaded with the purple
clusters. Tasting them, Carson justly remarked
that he had never eaten so good a grape.</p>

<p>"No," said his host, "I think not; neither
have I, though I have traveled through Europe.
The valley of the Rhine, nor of the Tagus,
produces anywhere a grape like ours. I
think that the Los Angelos grape is fit food
indeed for angels&mdash;is quite equal to the grapes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of Eshcol&mdash;you remember the heavy clusters
that were found there, so that two men carried
one between them on a pole resting upon their
shoulders. See that now," and he drew Carson
to a vine whose trunk was six inches
through, and yet it needed a prop to sustain
the weight of the two clusters of grapes it
bore.</p>

<p>A species of the cactus, called the prickly pear,
enclosed the vineyard, and this really bore pears,
or a fruit of light orange color, in the form of
a pear, but covered with a down of prickles.
The Indian boy brought a towel, and wiping
the fruit until it shone, gave to Carson to taste.
It was sweetish, juicy, and rich, but with less
of flavor than a pear. Beyond the vineyard
were groves of fig and orange trees. The figs
were hardly ripe, being the third crop of the
season, while the oranges were nearly fit for
picking. The host said that his oranges were
better than usual this season, but he did not
know what he should do with them. He was
in the habit of shipping them to Santa Barbara
and Monterey, and thence taking some to
San Jose; but latterly oranges had been
brought to Monterey from the Sandwich islands
by ships in the service of the Hudson Bay
Company, returning from the China trade to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the mouth of the Columbia, which, arriving
before his were ripe, he found the fruit market
forestalled.</p>

<p>"This is the finest country the sun shines
upon," said he, "and we can live luxuriously
upon just what will grow on our own farms;
but we cannot get rich. Our cattle will only
bring the value of the hides; our horses are
of little value, for there are plenty running
wild which good huntsmen can take with the
lasso; and, as for fruit, from which I had
hoped to realize something, the market is cut
off by Yankee competition. I think we shall
have the Americans with us before many years,
and for my part I hope we shall. The idea of
Californians generally, as well as of other Mexicans,
that they are too shrewd for them, is true
enough; but certainly there is plenty of room
for a large population, and I should prefer
that the race that has most enterprise, should
come and cultivate the country with us."</p>

<p>Carson's youth commanded him to listen,
rather than to advance his own sentiments;
but he expressed his pleasure at hearing his
host compliment the Americans, and said in
reply, "I have not been an extensive traveler,
and have chosen the life of a mountaineer, for
a time certainly; but since I came to California,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
I am half inclined to decide to make this
my home when I get tired of trapping. I like
the hunt, and have found game exceedingly
plenty here, but there is no buffalo, and I
want that. Give me buffalo, and I would settle
in California."</p>

<p>He described to his host a buffalo hunt in
which he engaged with the Sioux Indians,
before he left his father's home, at fifteen years
of age, and another later, since he came into
the mountains. He had hunted buffalo every
year since he was twelve years old.</p>

<p>The Don was charmed with the earnestness
and the frankness, and manifest integrity of
the youth, and turning his glance upon him,
with the slightly quizzical expression the face
a Spaniard so readily assumes, he inquired
how many buffalo he had ever killed.</p>

<p>"Not so many as I have deer, because I was
always in a deer country; but in the eight
years since I commenced going in the buffalo
ranges, I must have killed five hundred. The
hunter does not kill without he wishes to use.
I was often permitted to take a shot at the
animals before I was able to help in dressing
them."</p>

<p>But Carson felt it might seem like boasting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
for him to tell his own exploits, and changing
the theme, remarked,</p>

<p>"Your horses would make excellent buffalo
hunters, with the proper training, and I have
some at camp that I intend shall see buffalo.
But why do you not deal gently with them
when they are first caught, and keep the fire
they have in the herd? Pardon me, but I
think in taming your horses, you break their
spirits."</p>

<p>"My tutor has said the same, and I too
have thought so in regard to the Mexican
style of training our horses. We mount one
just caught from the drove, and ride him till
he becomes gentle from exhaustion. The
French do not train horses in that way, nor
the English; I have not been in the United
States. Our custom is brought from Spain;
and it answers well enough with us, where our
horses go in droves, and when one is used up,
we turn him out and take up another; but
when we take this animal again, he is just as
wild as at the first; we cannot afford to spend
time on breaking him when it must be done
over again directly."</p>

<p>And so the two hours, which Carson had
allotted for his visit, passed in easy chat, and
when he took his leave, his host expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
his thanks for his visit, and promised to return
it at the camp.</p>

<p>Carson did not again see his courteous host,
for early on the following morning, Mr. Young
found it necessary that he should get his men
away from Los Angelos as speedily as possible.
They had been indulging to excess in bad
liquors, and having none of the best feelings
towards the Mexicans, many quarrels, some
ending in bloodshed, had ensued.</p>

<p>He therefore despatched Carson ahead with
a few men, promising to follow and overtake
him at the earliest moment, and waiting another
day, he managed to get his followers in
a tolerably sober condition, and succeeded,
though not without much trouble, in getting
away without the loss of a man, though the
Mexicans were desperately enraged at the
death of one of their townsmen, who had been
killed in a chance fray. In three days he
overtook Carson, and the party, once more reunited,
advanced rapidly towards the Colorado
River, his men working with a heartiness and
cheerfulness, resulting from a consciousness
of their misconduct at Los Angelos, which, but
for the prudent discretion of Young and Carson,
might have resulted disastrously to all
concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
In nine days they were ready to commence
trapping on the Colorado, and in a short time
added here to the large stock of furs they had
brought from California.</p>

<p>Here while left in charge of the camp, with
only a few men, Carson found himself suddenly
confronted by several hundred Indians. They
entered the camp with the utmost assurance,
and acted as though they felt the power of
their numbers. Carson at once suspected that
all was not right, and attempting to talk with
them, he soon discovered that, with all their
<i>sang froid</i>, each of them carried his weapons
concealed beneath his garments, and immediately
ordered them out of camp. Seeing the
small number of the white men, the Indians
were not inclined to obey, but chose to wait
their time and do as they pleased, as they
were accustomed to do with the Mexicans.
They soon learned that they were dealing with
men of different mettle, for Carson was a man
not to be trifled with.</p>

<span class="caption">CARSON GOES AHEAD WITH THE PARTY.</span>
</div>

<p>His men stood around him, each with his
rifle resting in the hollow of the arm, ready
to be dropped to deadly aim on the sign from
their young commander. Carson addressed
the old chief in Spanish, (for he had betrayed
his knowledge of that language,) and warned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
him that though they were few, they were determined
to sell their lives dearly. The Indians
awed, it would seem, by the bold and defiant
language of Carson, and finding that any
plunder they might acquire, would be purchased
at a heavy sacrifice, sullenly withdrew,
and left the party to pursue their journey unmolested.</p>

<p>Any appearance of fear would have cost the
lives of Carson and probably of the whole
party, but the Indian warriors were too chary
of their lives to rush into death's door unprovoked,
even for the sake of the rich plunder
they might hope to secure. Carson's cool
bravery saved the trappers and all their
effects; and this first command in an Indian
engagement is but a picture of his conduct in
a hundred others, when the battles were with
weapons other than the tongue. The intention
of the Indians had been to drive away the
animals, first causing a stampede, when they
would become lawful plunder, but they dared
not undertake it.</p>

<p>The wily craftiness of the Indians induced
the necessity for constant vigilance against
them, and in the school this youth had been
in all his life, he had shown himself an apt
scholar.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p>While on the Colorado, Young's party discovered
a company of Indians, (with whom
they had had a previous skirmish,) as they were
coming out from Los Angelos, and charging
suddenly among them, succeeded in taking a
large herd of cattle from them in the Indians'
own style. The same week an Indian party
came past their camp in the night, with a drove
of a hundred horses, evidently just stolen from
a Mexican town in Sonora. The trappers,
with their guns for their pillows, were ready in
an instant for the onslaught, and captured these
horses also, the Indians hurrying away for fear
of the deadly rifle. The next day they selected
such as they wanted from the herd, choosing of
course the finest, and turning the rest loose, to
be taken again by the Indians, or to become
the wild mustangs that roamed the plains of
Northern Mexico, in droves of tens of thousands,
and which could be captured and tamed
only by the use of the lasso.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Mr. Young and his party trapped down the
Colorado and up the Gila with success, then
crossed to the vicinity of the New Mexican
copper mines, where they left their furs and
went to Santa Fe. Having procured there
license to trade with the Indians about the copper
mines, they returned thither for their furs,
went back to Santa Fe and disposed of them
to great advantage. The party disbanded with
several hundred dollars apiece, which most of
them expended as sailors do their earnings
when they come into port. Of course Carson
was hail fellow well met with them for a time.
He had not hitherto taken the lesson that all
have to learn, viz., that the ways of pleasure
are deceitful paths; and to resist temptation
needs a large amount of courage&mdash;larger perhaps
than to encounter any physical danger;
at least the moral courage it requires is of a
higher tone than the physical courage which
would carry one through a fight with a grizzly
bear triumphantly; that the latter assists the
former; indeed that the highest moral courage
must be aided by physical bravery, but that the
latter may exist entirely independently of the
former.</p>

<p>Carson learned during this season of hilarity
the necessity of saying No! and he did so persistently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
knowing that if he failed in this he
would be lost to himself and to everything dear
in life. He was now twenty-one, and though
the terrible ordeal of poverty had been nobly
borne, and he had conquered, the latter ordeal
of temptation from the sudden possession
of what was to him a large sum of money, had
proved for once, too much. And it is well for
him perhaps it was so; as it enabled him to
sow his wild oats in early youth.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that some of this party
belonged to the class of Canadians called <i>coureurs
des bois</i>, whose habits Mr. Irving thus describes
in his Astoria:</p>

<p>"A new and anomalous class of men gradually
grew out of this trade. These were called
<i>coureurs des bois</i>, rangers of the woods; originally
men who had accompanied the Indians
in their hunting expeditions, and made themselves
acquainted with remote tracts and tribes;
and who now became, as it were, pedlers of
the wilderness. These men would set out from
Montreal with canoes well stocked with goods,
with arms and ammunition, and would make
their way up the mazy and wandering rivers
that interlace the vast forests of the Canadas,
coasting the most remote lakes, and creating
new wants and habitudes among the natives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Sometimes they sojourned for months among
them, assimilating to their tastes and habits
with the happy facility of Frenchmen; adopting
in some degree the Indian dress, and not
unfrequently taking to themselves Indian
wives.</p>

<p>"Twelve, fifteen, eighteen months would often
elapse without any tidings of them, when they
would come sweeping their way down the Ottawa
in full glee, their canoes laden down with
packs of beaver skins. Now came their turn
for revelry and extravagance. 'You would be
amazed,' says an old writer already quoted,
'if you saw how lewd these pedlers are when
they return; how they feast and game, and
how prodigal they are, not only in their clothes,
but upon their sweethearts. Such of them as
are married have the wisdom to retire to their
own houses; but the bachelors do just as an
East Indiaman and pirates are wont to do; for
they lavish, eat, drink, and play all away as
long as the goods hold out; and when these
are gone, they even sell their embroidery, their
lace, and their clothes. This done, they are
forced upon a new voyage for subsistence.'"</p>

<p>Many of these <i>coureurs des bois</i> became so
accustomed to the Indian mode of living, and
the perfect freedom of the wilderness, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
they lost all relish for civilization, and identified
themselves with the savages among whom
they dwelt, or could only be distinguished from
them by superior licentiousness.</p>

<p>In the autumn Carson joined another trapping
party under Mr. Fitzpatrick, whom we
shall have frequent occasion to mention hereafter.
They proceeded up the Platte and
Sweet Water past Goose Creek to the Salmon
River, where they wintered, like other parties,
sharing the good will of the Nez Perces Indians,
and having the vexations of the Blackfeet
for a constant fear. Mr. Fitzpatrick, less
daring than Carson, declined sending him to
punish this tribe for their depredations.</p>

<p>In the spring they came to Bear river,
which flows from the north to Salt Lake.
Carson and four men left Mr. Fitzpatrick here,
and went ten days to find Captain Gaunt in
the place called the New Park, on the head
waters of the Arkansas, where they spent the
trapping season, and wintered. While the
party were wintering in camp, being robbed
of some of their horses by a band of sixty
Crow Indians, Carson, as usual, was appointed
to lead the party sent in pursuit of the plunderers.
With only twelve men he took up
the trail, came upon the Indians in one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
their strongholds, cut loose the animals, which
were tied within ten feet of the fort of logs in
which the enemy had taken shelter, attacked
them, killed five of their warriors, and made
good his retreat with the recovered horses; an
Indian of another tribe who was with the trappers
bringing away a Crow scalp as a trophy.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">C</a></p>

<p>In the spring, while trapping on the Platte
River, two men belonging to the party deserted
and robbed a <i>cache</i>, or underground deposit of
furs, which had been made by Captain Gaunt,
in the neighborhood. Carson, with only one
companion, went off in pursuit of the thieves,
who, however, were never heard of afterwards.</p>

<p>Not finding the plunderers, Carson and his
companion remained at the old camp on the
Arkansas, where the <i>cache</i> had been made,
until they were relieved by a party sent out
from the United States with supplies for Captain
Gaunt's trappers. They were soon after
joined by a party of Gaunt's men, and started
to his camp. On their way they had repeated
encounters with Indians attempting to
steal their horses, but easily beat them off and
saved their property.</p>

<p>On one occasion when Carson and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
trappers were out in search of <i>beaver sign</i>, they
came suddenly upon a band of sixty warriors
well armed and mounted. In the presence of
such a force their only safety was in flight.
Amid a shower of bullets from the Indian
rifles, they made good their escape. Carson
considered this one of his narrowest escapes.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p>In the spring of 1832, Mr. Gaunt's party had
been unsuccessful, and were now upon a stream
where there was no beaver, therefore Carson
announced his intention of hunting on his own
account. Two of his companions joined him,
and the three for the whole season pursued
their work successfully, high up in the mountain
streams, while the Indians were down in
the plains hunting buffalo; and taking their
fur to Taos, disposed of them at a remunerative
price. While the two former spent their
money in the usual way, Carson saved his
hard earnings which his companions were so
recklessly throwing away. This self-discipline,
and schooling himself to virtue and temperance,
was not without effort on the part
of Kit Carson, for he loved the good will and
kindly civilities of his companions; but he
knew also that he could not have his cake and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
eat it too, and chose to save his money and his
strength for future use.</p>

<p>While remaining at Taos, Captain Lee, formerly
of the United States army, now a partner
of Bent and St. Vrain, at Bent's Fort, invited
Carson to join an expedition which he
was arranging. Carson accepted his offer,
starting in October. Going northward they
came up with a party of twenty traders and
trappers, upon a branch of the Green River,
and all entered winter quarters here together.</p>

<p>Mr. Robideau had in his employ a Californian
Indian, very skillful in the chase&mdash;whether
for game or for human prey&mdash;very courageous,
and able to endure the greatest hardships, and
whose conduct hitherto had won the confidence
of all. This Indian had left clandestinely,
taking with him six of Mr. Robideau's
most valuable horses, which were worth at
least twelve hundred dollars. Mr. Robideau,
determined to recover them if possible, solicited
Carson to pursue and overtake the Indian.
Kit asked his employer, Mr. Lees', permission
to serve Mr. Robideau, which was readily
granted, when he at once prepared himself for
hard riding and sturdy resistance.</p>

<p>From a Utah village near he obtained an intelligent
and brave young warrior to join him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>&mdash;for
Carson's reputation for courage, skill,
and efficiency, were known to the tribes, and
many of its braves were attached to him, and
afterwards proved that they cherished a lasting
friendship for him.</p>

<p>For a time the blindness of the trail compelled
them to go slowly, but once sure of its
direction, they pursued it with the utmost
speed, down Green river, Carson concluding
the Indian was directing his course toward
California. When they had gone a hundred
miles on their way, the Indian's horse was
suddenly taken sick. The Indian would not
consent to continue the pursuit, as Carson suggested,
on foot, and he therefore determined to
go on alone, and putting spurs to his horse revolved
not to return until he had succeeded in
recovering Mr. Robideau's property. With
practiced eye ever upon the trail, he revolved
in his mind the expert skill he might need to
exercise in encountering the wily savage. This
desperate expedition Carson had boldly entered
into, not with rashness, but he had accepted it
as an occasion that demanded the hazard. At
the distance of thirty miles from where he left
his Utah companion, he discovered the object
of his chase. The Indian too had discovered
him, and to prepare himself for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
attack, turned to seek a shelter whence he
might fire and reload without exposure to the
shot from Carson's rifle&mdash;which he had unslung
when first he discovered the Indian.</p>

<p>With his horse at full speed, at the moment
the Indian reached his cover, Carson fired with
aim so true that the Indian gave one bound
and fell dead beside his horse, while his gun
went off at the same instant. No further particulars
of description or speculation can add
to the interest of this picture. We leave it to
the imagination of the reader, as an illustration
of the daring and fidelity of Kit
Carson. Collecting the horses, he soon had
the pleasure, after a few minor difficulties, of
presenting to Mr. Robideau, the six animals
he had lost, in as good condition as when they
were stolen, and of announcing to him the fact
that there lived one less rogue.</p>

<p>Soon after Carson's return to camp, some
trappers brought them news that Messrs. Fitzpatrick
and Bridger were camped fifteen miles
from them. Captain Lee and Carson at once
concluded that to them they might sell their
goods. They started for their camp and were
as successful as they had hoped, for they sold
their whole stock of goods to this party, and
took their pay in furs. Their contract being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
now completed, Carson joined Mr. Fitzpatrick
again in a trapping expedition, but did not
remain long with him, because the party was
too large to make it pay, or even to work harmoniously
together. With three men whom
he chose from the many who wished to join
him, Carson again commenced trapping on his
own account. They trapped all summer on
the Laramie, with unusual success. It was
while Carson was out on this tramp that he had
the adventure with the grizzly bears,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">D</a> which he
considered the most perilous that he ever
passed through. He had gone out from the
camp on foot to shoot game for supper, and
had just brought down an elk, when two grizzly
bears came suddenly upon him. His rifle
being empty, there was no way of escape from
instant death but to run with his utmost speed
for the nearest tree. He reached a sapling
with the bears just at his heels. Cutting off
a limb of the tree with his knife, he used that
as his only weapon of defence. When the
bears climbed so as nearly to reach him, he
gave them smart raps on the nose, which sent
them away growling; but when the pain ceased
they would return again only to have the
raps repeated. In this way nearly the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
night was spent, when finally the bears became
discouraged, and retired from the contest.
Waiting until they were well out of sight,
Carson descended from his unenviable position,
and made the best of his way into camp,
which he reached about daylight. The elk
had been devoured by wolves before it could
be found, and his three companions were only
too glad to see him, to be troubled about
breakfasting on beaver, as they had supped
the night before; for trappers in camp engaged
in their business had this resort for
food when all others failed.</p>

<p>Laramie river flows into the North Platte,
upon the south side. The country through
which it flows is open, yet the stream is bordered
with a variety of shrubbery, and in many spots
the cottonwood grows luxuriantly, and for this
reason, the locality is favorable for the grizzly
bear.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_092.jpg" width="303" height="450" alt="" /><br />
<span class="caption">"WHEN THE BEARS CLIMBED SO NEAR AS TO REACH HIM,
HE GAVE THEM SMART RAPS ON THE NOSE."</span>
</div>

<p>Baird says of this bear: "While the black
bear is the bear of the forest, the grizzly is the
bear of the chapparal, the latter choosing an
open country, whether plain or mountain, whose
surface is covered with dense thickets of manzanita
or shrub oak, which furnish him with his
favorite food, and clumps of service bushes, and
low cherry; and whose streams are lined with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
tangled thickets of low grape vine and wild
plumb." The grizzly is not so good at climbing
as the black bear, and can best manage by
resting upon his haunches and mounting with
his fore arms upon the bushes that he cannot
pull over, to gather the berries, of which he is
very fond.</p>

<p>"Only in a condition of hunger will he attack
a man unprovoked, but when he does,
the energy with which he fights, prevents the
Indians from seeking the sport of a hunt for
the grizzly bear. He is monarch of the plain,
with only their opposition, and has departed
only before the rifle of the white hunter. An
Indian, who would, alone, undertake to conquer
a dozen braves of another tribe, would
shrink from attacking a grizzly bear; and to
have killed one, furnishes a story for a life
time, and gives a reputation that descends to
posterity. The mounted hunter can rarely
bring his horse to approach him near enough
for a shot."</p>

<p>Soon after his encounter with the bears,
Carson and his men were rejoiced by the arrival
of Capt. Bridger, so long a mountaineer of
note, and with him his whole band. Carson
and his three companions joined with them,
and were safe; and now for the first time he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
attended the summer rendezvous of trappers
on the Green River, where they assembled for
the disposal of their furs, and the purchase of
such outfit as they needed.</p>

<p>Carson for the Fall hunt joined a company
of fifty, and went to the country of the Blackfeet,
at the head waters of the Missouri; but
the Indians were so numerous, and so determined
upon hostility, that a white man could not
leave his camp without danger of being shot
down; therefore, quitting the Blackfeet country,
they camped on the Big Snake River for
winter quarters.</p>

<p>During the winter months, the Blackfeet had
in the night run off eighteen of their horses,
and Kit Carson, with eleven men, was sent to
recover them, and chastise their temerity.
They rode fifty miles through the snow before
coming up with the Indians, and instantly
made an attempt to recover their animals,
which were loose and quietly grazing.</p>

<p>The Indians, wearing snow shoes, had the
advantage, and Carson readily granted the
parley they asked. One man from each party
advanced, and between the contending ranks
had a talk. The Indians informed them that
they supposed they had been robbing the
Snake Indians, and did not desire to steal from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
white men. Of course this tale was false, and
Carson asked why they did not lay down their
arms and ask for a smoke, but to this they had
no reply to make. However, both parties laid
aside their weapons and prepared for the
smoke; and the lighted calumet was puffed by
every one of the savages and the whites alternately,
and the head men of the savages made
several long non-committal speeches, to which,
in reply, the trappers came directly to the
point, and said they would hear nothing of
conciliation from them until their property was
returned.</p>

<p>After much talk, the Indians brought in five
of the poorest horses. The whites at once
started for their guns, which the Indians did
at the same time, and the fight at once commenced.
Carson and a comrade named Markland
having seized their rifles first, were at the
lead, and selected for their mark two Indians
who were near each other and behind different
trees; but as Kit was about to fire, he perceived
Markland's antagonist aiming at him
with death-like precision, while Markland had
not noticed him, and on the instant, neglecting
his own adversary, he sent a bullet through the
heart of the other savage, but at the moment
saw that his own enemy's rifle was aimed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
his breast. He was not quite quick enough to
dodge the ball, and it struck the side of his
neck, and passed through his shoulder, shattering
the bone.</p>

<p>Carson was thenceforward only a spectator
of the fight, which continued until night, when
both parties retired from the field of battle and
went into camp.</p>

<p>Carson's wound was very painful, and bled
freely, till the cold checked the flow of blood.
They dared not light a fire, and in the cold and
darkness, Carson uttered not a word of complaint,
nor did even a groan escape him. His
companions were earnest in their sympathy,
but he was too brave to need it, or to allow his
wound to influence the course they should pursue.
In a council of war which they held, it
was decided that, as they had slain several
Indians, and had themselves only one wounded,
they had best return to camp, as they were in
unfit condition to continue the pursuit. Arriving
at camp, another council was held, at
which it was decided to send thirty men under
Capt. Bridger, to pursue and chastise these
Blackfeet thieves. This party followed the
Indian trail several days, but finally returned,
concluding it was useless to search further, as
they had failed to overtake them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p>The Spring hunt opened on the Green
river, and continuing there a while, the party
went to the Big Snake; and after trapping
with extraordinary success for a few weeks,
returned to the Summer rendezvous, held
again upon the Green River. Meantime Carson
had recovered from his wound.</p>

<p>An unusually large number of trappers and
traders, with great numbers from the neighboring
Indian tribes, assembled at this rendezvous,
made up of Canadians, Frenchmen, Dutchmen,
Spaniards, and many a backwoodsman, who
had lived upon the borders, perhaps, for three
generations, removing when a neighbor came
within ten miles, because <i>near</i> neighbors
were a nuisance to him. Let us see the
parties as they come in, the leader, or the one
to whom fitness accords this position, having
selected the spot for the camp, so remote from
every other, as to have plenty of grass about it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
for the animals of the party. Perhaps a tent
is spread, at least, everything is put in proper
order, according to the notions and the tastes
of the men who make up the party; for the
camp is the home of its members, and here
they will receive visitors, and exchange courtesies.</p>

<p>The party or parties that have made the
special arrangements for the rendezvous&mdash;traders
with a full supply of goods&mdash;have spread
a large tent in a central spot of the general
encampment, where the whole company, save
those detained at each camp in charge of the
animals belonging to it, will assemble, at certain
hours each day, the time upon which the
sales are announced to take place, and the exchanges
commence.</p>

<p>The several parties arriving first, have been
obliged to wait until all expected for the season
have arrived, because there is a feeling of
honor as well as a care for competition, that
compels the custom. The traders take furs or
money for their goods, which bring prices that
seem fabulous to those unaccustomed to the
sight or stories of mountain life. The charge,
of course, is made upon the ground of the expense
and risk of bringing goods eight hundred
and a thousand miles into the wilderness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
from the nearest points in western Missouri
and St. Louis.</p>

<p>Irving opens his Astoria with the following:
"Two leading objects of commercial gain, have
given birth to wide daring and enterprise in
the early history of the Americas; the precious
metals of the South and the rich peltries
of the North." When he wrote this, it was true
of the localities he named&mdash;the gold was not
yet an attraction, except in the south, and
only the British Fur Company in Canada had
become an object of history in this branch of
trade. He says, "While the fiery and magnificent
Spaniard, influenced with the mania
for gold, has extended his discoveries and conquests
over those brilliant countries, scorched
by the ardent sun of the tropics, the adroit
Frenchman, and the cool and calculating Briton,
have pursued the less splendid, but no
less lucrative, traffic in furs, amidst the hyper-borean
regions of the Canadas, until they advanced
even within the Artic Circle.</p>

<p>"These two pursuits have thus, in a manner,
been the pioneers and precursors of civilization.
Without pausing on the borders,
they have penetrated at once, in defiance of
difficulties and dangers, to the heart of savage
countries; laying open the hidden secrets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the wilderness; leading the way to remote
regions of beauty and fertility, that might
have remained unexplored for ages, and beckoning
after them the slow and pausing steps
of agriculture and civilization. It was the fur
trade, in fact, that gave early sustenance and
vitality to the great Canadian provinces.</p>

<p>"Being destitute of the precious metals,
they were for a long time neglected by the
parent country. The French adventurers,
however, who had settled on the banks of the
St. Lawrence, soon found that in the rich peltries
of the interior, they had sources of wealth
that might almost rival the mines of Mexico
and Peru." The Indians, as yet unacquainted
with the artificial value given to some descriptions
of furs, in civilized life, brought quantities
of the most precious kinds and bartered
them away for European trinkets and cheap
commodities. Immense profits were thus
made by the early traders, and the traffic was
pursued with avidity.</p>

<p>"As the valuable furs became scarce in the
neighborhood of the settlements, the Indians
of the vicinity were stimulated to take a wider
range in their hunting expeditions; they were
generally accompanied on these expeditions by
some of the traders or their dependants, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
shared in the toils and perils of the chase, and at
the same time, made themselves acquainted with
the best hunting grounds, and with the remote
tribes whom they encouraged to bring peltries
to the settlements. In this way the trade augmented,
and was drawn from remote quarters
to Montreal. Every now and then a large
body of Ottawas, Hurons, and other tribes who
hunted the countries bordering on the great
lakes, would come down in a squadron of light
canoes, laden with beaver skins and other
spoils of the year's hunting. The canoes
would be unladen, taken on shore, and their
contents disposed in order. A camp of birch-bark
would be pitched outside of the town,
and a kind of primitive fair opened with that
grave ceremonial so dear to the Indians.</p>

<p>"Now would ensue a brisk traffic with the
merchants, and all Montreal would be alive
with naked Indians, running from shop to
shop, bargaining for arms, kettles, knives,
axes, blankets, bright-colored cloths, and other
articles of use or fancy; upon all which, the
merchants were sure to clear two hundred per
cent.</p>

<p>"Their wants and caprices being supplied,
they would take leave, strike their tents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
launch their canoes, and ply their way up the
Ottawa to the lakes."</p>

<p>Later, the French traders, <i>couriers des bois</i>,
penetrated the remote forests, carrying such
goods as the Indians required, and held rendezvous
among them, on a smaller scale, but
similar to the one Carson had attended, so far
as the Indian trade was concerned. But the
Yankee element of character preponderated
among the traders and trappers from the
States; besides the greater difficulty and expense
necessarily incurred to reach the hunting
grounds by land than in canoe, called into
the work only men of energy and higher skill
than the employees, mostly French, in the service
of the Hudson Bay Fur Company, and a
score of smaller parties, each owning no authority
outside itself, adopted the plan of these summer
encampments, during the season when the
fur of the beaver and the otter was not good, as
an arrangement for mutual convenience; and
the Indians of this more southern section
availed themselves of the occasion, for their
own pleasure and profit, and to the advantage
and satisfaction of the traders, whose prices
ruled high in proportion to the difficulty of
transit, as well as the monopoly in their hands
of the articles deemed necessary to the trapper's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
dress, culinary establishment, and outfit.
These consisted of a woolen shirt, a sash or
belt, and with some stockings, coffee, and
black pepper, and salt, unless he could supply
himself from the licks the buffalo visits;
with tin kettle, and cup, and frying pan; the
accoutrements of the horse, saddle and packsaddle,
bridle, spurs, and horse-shoes; with material
for bait; and last, but not least, tobacco,
which if he did not use, he carried to give to
the Indians&mdash;made up not only the necessaries,
but the luxuries which the Indian and
the white man indulged in, and for which, at
such times, they paid their money or their
furs.</p>

<p>Perhaps the trapper took an Indian wife,
and then she must be made fine with dress,
denoting the dignity of her position as wife of
a white man, and presents must be given to
the friends of his bride. This was usually an
expensive luxury, but indulged in most frequently
by the French and Canadian trappers,
many of whom are now living quietly upon
their farms in Oregon and California, and the
numerous valleys of the West. Indeed we
might give the names of many a mountain
ranger, and pioneer of note, first a trapper,
who still lives surrounded by his Indian wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and their children, and finds himself thus connected
with this people, having their utmost
confidence, chosen the chief of his tribe, and
able to care for them as no one not in such association
could.</p>

<p>At almost any point upon Green River the
grass upon the bottom lands is sufficient for a
night's encampment for a small party; but at
the place selected for the rendezvous, in the
space of two or three miles upon either side of
the river, the bottom spreads out in a broad
prairie, and the luxuriant growth of grass,
with the country open all about it, made the
spot desirable for a large encampment.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p>Early in the summer the grass is green,
but later it is hay made naturally, root and
branch dried on the ground&mdash;there is no sod&mdash;and
this, though less agreeable, is more nutritious
for the animals than fresh grass.</p>

<p>A scattered growth of fine old trees furnishes
shade at every camp, and immediately
about the great tent they afford protection from
the sun to parties of card players, or a "Grocery
stand," at which the principal article of
sale is "whiskey by the glass;" and perhaps,
further on is a <i>monte</i> table, parties from several
Indian tribes, and the pioneer of semi-civilization&mdash;the
back-woodsman&mdash;has come in
"with his traps," a few bags of flour, and possibly
some cheese and butter, and the never
failing cask of whiskey. Perhaps his wagon
is the grocery stand, to which we have just alluded.
Without extenuation, these encampments
were grand occasions of which a few descriptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
may be found written at the time by
men of science and intellectual culture, like
Sir Wm. Stewart, who traveled upon these
plains for pleasure, or the Rev. Samuel
Parker, who happened at a Green River rendezvous,
in 1835, while on his way to the Columbia
River, under the auspices of the American
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.
This was long before Brigham Young
came West&mdash;before his scheme of religious
colonization had its birth.</p>

<p>There is now&mdash;has been for years&mdash;a trading
post where a Canadian Frenchman and an
American partner, with Indian wives, have
provided entertainment or furnished supplies
to emigrants and Indians. It is near the
Green River crossing, on the road from the
South Pass to great Salt Lake City, via Fort
Bridger.</p>

<p>Amid the motley company it might be expected
that quarrels would arise, and disorderly
conduct, growing out of the feuds among
the tribes of Indians. These were kept in
abeyance as much as possible, and already
Carson's popularity with them enabled him
to act the part of peace-maker between
them and the quarrelsome whites, as well
as between each other, for many of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
recognized him as the brave who had led
excursions, whose success they had felt and
suffered, and even though leader of victorious
parties against themselves, they admired his
prowess still; for the party of Blackfeet came
to the rendezvous under the protection of the
white flag, and for the time, no one more truly
buried the hatchet than Carson, though just
recovered from a wound given by a party of
that tribe, which had nearly cost him his life,
and of which we have written in a previous
chapter.</p>

<p>There was belonging to one of the trapping
parties a Frenchman by the name of Shuman,
known at the rendezvous as "the big bully of
the mountains," exceedingly annoying on account
of his boasts and taunts, a constant exciter
of tumult and disorder, especially among
the Indians. Bad enough at any time, with
the means now for intoxication, he was even
more dangerous.</p>

<p>The habits of the mountaineers, without
law save such as the exigency of the moment
demanded, required a firm, steady hand to rule.
Carson had feared the results of this man's
lawlessness, and had often desired to be rid of
him, but he had not as yet found the proper
opportunity. The mischiefs he committed grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
worse and worse, and yet for the sake of peace
they were borne unresistingly. At length an
opportunity offered to try his courage. One
day Shuman, boasting of his exploits, was particularly
insolent and insulting toward all
Americans, whom he described as only fit to
be whipped with switches. Carson was in the
crowd, and immediately stepped forward, saying,
"I am an American, the most inconsiderable
one among them, but if you wish to die, I
will accept your challenge."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_110.jpg" width="306" height="450" alt="" /><br />
<span class="caption">CARSON WAS IN THE CROWD, AND IMMEDIATELY STEPPED
FORWARD SAYING, "I AM AN AMERICAN."</span>
</div>

<p>Shuman defied him. He was sitting upon
his horse, with his loaded rifle in his hand.
Carson leaped upon his horse with a loaded
pistol, and both rushed into close combat.
They fired, almost at the same moment, but
Carson an instant before his boasting antagonist.
Their horses' heads touched, Shuman's
ball just grazing Carson's cheek, near the left
eye, and cutting off some locks of his hair. Carson's
ball entered Shuman's hand, came out at
the wrist, and passed through his arm above the
elbow. The bully begged for his life, and it
was spared; and from that time forward,
Americans were no more insulted by him.</p>

<p>If, as in other duels, we were to go back to
remoter causes, and find in this too, the defence
of woman&mdash;a Blackfoot beauty&mdash;whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Shuman had determined to abuse, which Carson's
interference only had prevented, for the
sake of truth, of honor, and virtue, as against
insolence, falsehood, and treachery, although
the girl did belong to a tribe that was treacherous;
we shall be but giving a point to the
story that it needs for completeness, and show
Carson in the exalted manliness and fidelity of
his character.</p>

<p>The trappers made arrangements at the rendezvous
for the fall hunt; and the party who
were so fortunate as to secure Carson's services,
went to the Yellowstone River, in the
Blackfeet country, but met with no success.
Crossing through the Crows' country to the
Big Horn River, they met the party of Blackfeet
returning from Green River. Carson held
a parley with them, as was his custom whenever
it was safe to go to an Indian camp. He
told them he had seen none of their people,
and that the tomahawk was buried if they
were faithful to him. "But," said he, "the
Crows are my friends, and while I am with
them, they must be yours."</p>

<p>On the Big Horn, too, their success was no
better, and Carson did not meet his Crow
friends. On the Big Snake, too, which they
next visited, the result was the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
They here met a party from the Hudson
Bay Company, led by a Mr. McCoy. Carson
and five of his companions accepted the offer
he made them, and went with him to the
Humboldt river, trapping with little success
from its source to the desert where it
loses itself, and where the termini of several
other large rivers are all within a day's ride,
according to the statement of residents at this
point. Capt. McCoy said to Carson, as he and
two of the company started off upon the desert,</p>

<p>"Do not be gone longer than to-morrow
night, and if you strike a stream where there
is beaver&mdash;there must be water between here
and those snow mountains&mdash;we will trap a few
days longer."</p>

<p>On they rode over the artemisia plain till
the lake was out of view from an eminence
which Carson climbed; then struck a tract of
country entirely destitute of every sign of animal
or vegetable life, with surface as smooth
as the floor for miles in extent, then broken
by a ridge a few feet high, like the rim to a
lake, whose bottom they had passed, to plunge
immediately upon another like it, with perhaps
a white and glistening crystalization
spread thinly over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Carson knew he must be upon the celebrated
Mud Lakes of which he had heard, and of
which he had seen miniature specimens further
east. Over these lake bottoms of earth, that
broken, seemed like mingled sand and ashes,
but which bore the tread of their horses, and
over which they seemed to fly rather than to
step, so fragrant and exhilarating was the atmosphere,
they traveled thirty miles, then
struck the artemisia plains again, only there
was less of even this worthless production for
the next ten miles than he had seen before for
long a distance.</p>

<p>Through a heavy sand, the weary horses
plod, for they had come forty or fifty miles
beneath a burning sun without food and without
water. On they ride, for rest and refreshment
to themselves was not to be thought of till
they have it for the animals. The river is
gained! a broad, deep current of water,
muddy like that of the Platte, supplies the
moisture to the trees, whose tops ascend only
a few feet above the desert level, and whose
trunks rise from green meadows but little
above the surface of the water. The bottom
lands are narrow, and the abrupt bank descends
to the water perpendicularly twenty
feet or more, seemingly of clayey earth, so soft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the water constantly wore upon it, and evidently
the river channel was settling, as the
years advanced. There were no signs of beaver,
and, from the nature of the banks, there
could be none, unless high up on the stream.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p>Capt. McCoy had calculated that he would
soon find game in the country through which
his route lay, and therefore he had turned over
to Carson, and the division of the party under
his command, nearly all the food which was
left, but this was insufficient to give them full
meals for more than three days. Their prospect
was a dreary one indeed, for at the earlier
season of coming down the river, they had
not half enough to eat, even with the few beaver
they had taken, to add to the supply,
and even this was now denied them. And now,
that the reader may understand Carson's position,
we invite him to enjoy with us a few of
the incidents passed through, and views observed
in our passage up this river, which the
untraveled eastern man would find so entirely
new, and the man of travel and of letters would
find so full of interest, as did the man whose
name the river bears, for it was named by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Fremont, after Carson, whom he had learned
to love and respect, long before he reached it.
We shall speak especially of the features of
this country, common to so much that lies between
the civilizations of the Atlantic and the
Pacific slopes, though the latter was not a
civilization; and when from the desert Carson
gazed with admiration at the snow mountains,
he surmised, as he afterwards realized through
hunger, cold, danger, and suffering, that this
was the chain of mountains which separated
him from California.</p>

<p>At the station-house, upon the lake, called
the Sink of the Humboldt, we were told that
the Humboldt did not connect with this lake,
except in the spring season, after the rains;
and that for the last two years it had not been
connected even at that time; and that in the
autumn one could pass between the lake and
the limit of the marsh in which the river loses
itself, upon dry ground; and that the sinks,
or the margins of the lakes or marshes in
which the Carson, the Walker, and the Susan
Rivers, neither of them less than a hundred
miles in length, and some of them several
hundred, in the wet season empty or lose
themselves, were all within the limit of a single
day's ride, and in the direct vicinity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
desert upon which the reader last saw Carson.</p>

<p>It was the evening of the second of July,
during a rain storm, (an unusual occurrence at
this season of the year, no traveler having
ever reported a similar one so far as we had
heard,) that, weary, and wet, and cold, we
found our way in the dark to this river in the
wilderness. The house of the traders at the
sink was made of logs, with two rooms&mdash;the
logs having been drawn from the mountains,
forty miles distant. There was no timber in
sight, and nothing that was green except some
grass about the lake, which we were told was
poison, and on examining, we found it encrusted
with a crystalization of potash, left on
it by the subsiding water in which the grass
had started.</p>

<p>During the wet season, the water of the lake
overflows its banks, and the banks of the river
are also overflowed, while the water standing
upon the surface of the ground is strongly
impregnated with potash, not only near the
sink, but far up the stream, nearly to its
source, the same cause existing, though only in
occasional spots is it exhibited to the same degree
as about the lake. It is not improbable
that some immense coal formation might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
been consumed here in some remote past age,
though that is a matter for more scientific examination
than becomes this work.</p>

<p>But, to leave speculation; the occupants of
the station, whilom trappers in the mountains,
furnished barley for our animals, and we
might have purchased coffee, or a rusty gun,
or bad whiskey, but little else, for their regular
supplies for the emigrants who were soon
expected to arrive, had not yet come in. The
parties bound east had passed, and the Mormons,
with their herds of cattle for the California
markets, had been met beyond the
desert. A party of Pah Utah or Piete Indians,
a tribe of Diggers, were hanging about
the encampment, and possibly had caused the
stampede of the Mormon oxen, which one of
their herdsmen had reported to us as occurring
here. The traders on the plains are charged
with conniving at such expeditions of the Indians,
and of sharing with them the plunder.
These traders may not have been privy to any
thing of the kind, but certain it is they always
stood ready to purchase the worn out stock of
the overland emigrants, much of which is
worthless to cross the desert, after the prior
fifteen hundred miles of travel.</p>

<p>This is made a lucrative business, as will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
readily imagined, when the number of animals
driven over is taken into consideration, which
has amounted to a hundred thousand annually,
by this route, during several of the years since
the quest for gold.</p>

<p>The traders said they had twenty-five hundred
horses and as many oxen, in charge of
herdsmen in a mountain valley. Shrewd men
they were, one of them with an eye we would
not warrant to look out from a kindly soul.</p>

<p>Miserable wretches were these Humboldt
Diggers, with scarcely a trace of humanity in
their composition, for they have not improved
since Carson first met them, many years ago.
The old chief was delighted with a lump of
sugar, which one of our party gave him. He
wore a long coat made of rabbit skins, warm
and durable, strips of the skin with the hair
out being wound around a deerskin thong,
and these rolls woven into a garment, but the
rest of the party were nearly naked.</p>

<p>Passing Lassen's meadows where the party
lunched at a spring, indicated, as we approached,
by a growth of willows, and striking
upon the artemisia plain that constitutes the
larger portion of the river valley, when about
fifty miles from the station, we left the road by
a blind trail, and approached the river, descending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to the bottom land by a precipitous
bluff thirty feet in height. The mountains
approached close on the opposite side of the
river, probably a mile distant, and enclosed us
in a semi-circle, while the bluff was lined with
a scattered growth of alders.</p>

<p>It rained, was raining violently when we
halted, and stretching a rope from alder to
alder, with a blanket thrown over it, we thus
made a tent, and established ourselves cosily
to spend here the nation's Sabbath-day, the
4th of July.</p>

<p>The rain turned into snow towards evening,
and covered the mountains to their base, but
melting as it fell where we were encamped,
and with the cooing of the doves which filled
the alders, the croaking of the frogs in the
marsh next the river, and the patter of the
rain upon the bushes, we had other music&mdash;nature's
deep bass&mdash;in a constant roaring
sound, like that of old ocean at full tide on a
sand beach of the open coast of the Pacific; or
like the sound of Niagara, heard half a mile
away, but there was no discoverable cause.</p>

<p>Going a mile up and down the river from
the camp&mdash;if there is up and down to a dead
river&mdash;we still heard the sound, the same in
tone and power. Our Wyandotte&mdash;a member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of the party who had crossed the plains with
Col. Fremont&mdash;suggested that it was "the
Humboldt sinking."</p>

<p>All the day of the 4th of July we rested
here, with our animals in clover, amid the
snow which reached even to the foot of the
mountains opposite, and the dirge played for
us by the unseen hand. It was a quiet, still
sweetly sad day&mdash;pleasant in memory, and
such an one as we shall never spend again&mdash;so
far from civilized humanity, and in a place so
remote from human footsteps, it seemed a natural
wonder which had never been properly
examined and explained.</p>

<p>Sooner than the old trappers anticipated,
will the Humboldt be lined with farms, and
the little mountain valleys filled with grazing
herds, and the church spire and the cross upon
an unassuming building in the centre of a six
mile square prairie, indicate the advance of
civilization. Yet, except in the mud-lake localities,
there is no tract of country that can
well be more unpromising than that about the
Humboldt; and not many years will elapse
before science will make plain and palpable
that wonder of the world, "the sinking of the
Humboldt."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p>Through the country we have thus briefly
described, Carson and his men had trapped
taking some small game, intending to return
late in the season when the cold of this high
altitude, with the sun low, was becoming terribly
severe, while the grass was dead, and the
birds of passage had all departed. Their
prospects were cheerless and unpromising, nor
were they at all improved after they left the
Humboldt; for their route lay through an artemisia
desert, varied only by an occasional little
valley, where springs of water in the early
season had induced the growth of grass.</p>

<p>On reaching Goose Creek, they found it frozen,
so that there was no possibility of finding
even roots, to satisfy their hunger. Though
to-day this is the trail of California emigration,
with plenty of grass, for a great portion of the
way, in its season; now all was desolate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
inured as they were to hardship, Carson's men
had never before suffered so much from hunger,
nor did their animals fare much better.
Capt. McCoy had taken with him all not
needed by Carson's party, because he could
give them food, and it was fortunate for them
he had adopted this course.</p>

<p>The magnificent mountain scenery on the
route could scarcely excite admiration or remark
from this company of hungry, toil-worn
men; even that unique exhibition of nature's
improvised ideality, done in stone&mdash;pyramid
circle&mdash;with its pagodas, temples, obelisks,
and altars, within a curiously wrought rock
wall, they only wished were the <i>adobe</i> walls
and houses of Fort Hall. However, nothing
daunted by the dreary prospect before them,
they here bled their horses, and drank the
precious draught, well knowing they were
taking the wind from the sails upon which
they must rely to waft them into port, if they
ever reached it.</p>

<p>The next day, they were meditating the
slaughter of one of their horses, when a party
of Snake Indians fortunately came in sight.
They had been out on the war trail, and returning,
had little food, but Carson managed
to purchase a fat horse, which they killed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
once, and thus managed to live luxuriously
till they reached the fort, able now to walk
and give the horses the advantage of their
diet.</p>

<p>Epicureans of civilization, when the squeamishness
of an appetite, perverted by too delicate
fare, is invited to such a repast, may rest
assured that they know not the satisfaction
such fare afforded to Kit Carson and his party.
Horse beef was sweeter food to these starving
men, than epicures had ever tasted.</p>

<p>After recruiting for a few days at the fort,
and learning that there were large herds of
the game, which they gloried most in hunting,
the buffalo, near by, Carson and his party
started for the stream on which they could be
found, and were not long in discovering a large
herd of fine fat buffalo. Stretching lines on
which to hang the strips, they killed, and
dressed, and cut; and soon had dried all the
meat their animals could carry, when they returned
to the fort.</p>

<p>Three days before reaching the fort, a party
of Blackfeet Indians were again upon their
trail, and watching for their return.</p>

<p>On the third morning after their arrival, just
as day dawned, two of the Indians came past
their camp to the <i>corral</i> of the fort in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
their animals were confined, let down the bars
and drove them all away; the sentinel thinking
the Indians were men of his party who
had come to relieve his watch, had gone into
camp and was soundly sleeping before the animals
were missed. By this time the Indians
had driven them many miles away, and as a
similar <i>ruse</i> had been played upon the people
at the fort a few days before, by which all their
animals were run off, there was no possibility
of giving chase.</p>

<p>Of course there was now no alternative but
to wait the return of Capt. McCoy from Walla
Walla, which he did in about four weeks,
bringing animals enough to supply Carson and
his party, besides, the men at the fort, which
had been obtained of the Kiowas, or Kaious
Indians, in Oregon. These Indians range between
the Cascade and the Rocky Mountains,
in what is now the eastern portion of Washington
and Oregon Territories, living by the
chase, and owning immense herds of horses,
of which the chief of this tribe owned ten thousand.
In this same locality the Indian bands
reported by the parties of trappers in the
American Fur Company, had abundance of
horses, with which they hunted deer, "ringing
or surrounding them, and running them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
down in a circle." But while antelope, and
elk, and deer, as well as beaver, were abundant,
their locality was not frequented by the
buffalo, its ranges being further toward the
south and west.</p>

<p>Many suppose that buffalo never existed west
of the Rocky Mountains; but to attempt a correction
of this impression with our readers, is
no longer necessary, as we have seen Carson killing
them on the Salmon River, on the Green
River, and lastly, in the valley of a stream
that flows into the Salmon.</p>

<p>From Baird's General Repository, published
in 1857, we quote,</p>

<p>"It will perhaps excite surprise that I include
the buffalo in the fauna of the Pacific
States, as it is common to imagine that the
buffalo has always been confined to the Atlantic
slopes, because it does not now extend
beyond the Rocky mountains. This is not
true. They once abounded on the Pacific."</p>

<p>This animal has not been found in California
nor in Oregon, west of the Cascade mountains,
within the present generation of men,
and the limit of its ranges, narrowing every
year, is now far this side of the Rocky Mountains.
Really a wild animal, incapable of
being domesticated, as the country is more and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
more traversed, he retires&mdash;is killed by thousands
by the hunter&mdash;and seems destined, as
really as the Indian race, to become extinct.
Could either be induced to adopt the modes of
life which residence among the races of civilized
men requires, their existence might be
prolonged perhaps for centuries, but there
seems to be no care, on the part of anybody
who has the power, to preserve either the Indian
or the buffalo as a distinct race of man,
and quadruped.</p>

<p>A writer who reports his trip from California
in the summer of '57, by Humboldt
River and Fort Laramie, says:</p>

<p>"I watched for buffalo, expecting to see
them in the valleys of the streams, the head-waters
of the Platte. But the hundred miles upon
the Sweet-water revealed no buffalo; upon
the North Platte above Laramie there were
none, and on to Fort Kearney we looked in
vain for this noble game. If we had been a
wagon party, and therefore confined to the
road, this would not have surprised us, as the
immense emigration to California first, to Salt
Lake next, and the United States army following,
might be supposed to have driven them
away. Then, too, Col. Sumner had been
through, and with a war party of three hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
mounted riflemen, had followed the Cheyennes
from Fort Laramie south to the head-waters
of the Arkansas. But we frequently
left the road for days together, in pursuit of
game and the finer scenery of the immediate
river valley, or the hills as it happened.</p>

<p>"Only until three days after passing Fort
Kearney, did the glad sight greet us.</p>

<p>"In the broad bottom&mdash;ten miles at least between
the hills that shut in the river valley&mdash;they
were scattered thickly and quietly grazing.</p>

<p>"In two hours after coming in sight of them,
we pitched our camp upon the river bank, and
were soon prepared for the hunt. Though ten
thousand were in sight, we had not yet approached
within half a mile of one, so shy are
they, moving off when we came in sight.</p>

<p>"The Platte was three quarters of a mile
wide where we were camped, and above and
below us were numerous trails running from
the river back into the hills. These were like
the cow-paths running to a spring in a New
England pasture. We camped about three
o'clock, and soon after the buffalo upon one
side of the stream commenced moving towards
the river by these paths, and following each
other close, to wade across it in a continuous
line by half a dozen paths in sight from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
where we were. These moving lines of huge
animals were continued till slumber closed our
eyes, at ten o'clock in the evening, and we
knew not how much longer.</p>

<p>"Having no fresh animals, and only one
that had not made the distance from the other
side the Sierra Nevada within the last fifty
days, we could not hunt by the chase. Accordingly,
with nicely loaded double barrelled
rifle, we crept through the under-brush that
lined the bank above us, and came near a line
of buffalo crossing the river, and choosing our
opportunity, as the animal pauses from the
brisk trot before plunging into the stream, we
were able to take good aim, and soon had
lodged a ball in the breast of a fine cow, who
with a bound leaped into the water, but was
not able to proceed, nor needed the other shot
which we lodged in the brain, to float her down
the stream.</p>

<p>"Calling help, we had her dressed directly,
and the nicest steaks upon the coals already
kindled at the camp, and found them exceedingly
delicious&mdash;of course more so from the
fact that we had taken it. Others of the party
came in without success; some had shot at a
buffalo, others had got a sight of one, and at
two of the crossings the line was broken temporarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
by an unsuccessful attempt to kill an
animal, but without hurting him. Most of us
had no practice with this kind of game, though
they had killed grouse, and some of them had
shot antelope during our journey. But now
their guns would not go off, or they shot too
high, or could not get near enough. Just at
dark, however, the old gentleman came in for
help. His French rifle&mdash;a gun of Revolutionary
times&mdash;had done execution, and a big
bull was the prize he announced. We invited
him to our prepared repast, but 'no! he would
sup to-night upon his own game, he thanked
us.' Of course he had the tongue from the animal
he killed, nor were the tender-loin and
other choice bits bad eating, and taking the
tongue ourself, with the rest of the party, (of
ten,) we managed to carry away in the morning
nearly all of the cow that we had not already
eaten.</p>

<p>"All night long the bellowing from the
other side the river greeted our tired senses.
The situation was novel, and really in imagination,
quite terrific. Would they return
across the river and stampede our animals?
We got a little sleep before midnight, but not
much later.</p>

<p>"In the morning the buffalo were indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
returning in the style they went, but as we
rode on over their track, the lines were always
broken, and the animals scattered before we
could approach them, and only once did we
come within pistol shot of any of them; nor
did the rest of the party do any better.</p>

<p>"Of course we might have done it had we
made this our business; but we were hastening
from the El Dorado, after a four years' absence
from our homes. So much for our <i>extemporised</i>
buffalo hunting. In twenty-four
hours after striking them, we had passed the
buffalo, and saw no more of them. As we estimated
it, we had seen in that time at least fifty
thousand; we had crossed the trail of fifteen
lines of them crossing the river after we left
camp this morning."</p>

<p>We have quoted this to show the way in
which travelers&mdash;emigrants now&mdash;meet the
buffalo. Sometimes a huge drove of them
overrun an emigrant party; but this seldom
occurs, nor do parties often see more of them
than did the one we have just presented,
though usually they see them for a longer
time. So much have the times changed since
Carson was a trapper.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p>With fresh animals, and men well fed and
rested, McCoy and Carson and all their party
soon started from Fort Hall, for the rendezvous
again upon Green River, where they were detained
some weeks for the arrival of other parties,
enjoying as they best might the occasion,
and preparing for future operations.</p>

<p>A party of an hundred was here organized,
with Mr. Fontenelle and Carson for its leaders,
to trap upon the Yellowstone, and the head
waters of the Missouri. It was known that
they would probably meet the Blackfeet in
whose grounds they were going, and it was
therefore arranged, that, while fifty were to
trap and furnish the food for the party, the
remainder should be assigned to guard the
camp and cook. There was no disinclination
on the part of any to another meeting with the
Blackfeet, so often had they troubled members
of the party, especially Carson, who, while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
could be magnanimous towards an enemy, would
not turn aside from his course, if able to cope
with him; and now he was in a company which
justly felt itself strong enough to punish the
"thieving Blackfeet," as they spoke of them,
he was anxious to pay off some old scores.</p>

<p>They saw nothing, however, of these Indians;
but afterwards learned that the small-pox
had raged terribly among them, and that
they had kept themselves retired in mountain
valleys, oppressed with fear and severe disease.</p>

<p>The winter's encampment was made in this
region, and a party of Crow Indians which was
with them, camped at a little distance, on the
same stream. Here they had secured an
abundance of meat, and passed the severe
weather with a variety of amusements in
which the Indians joined them in their lodges,
made of buffalo hides. These lodges, very
good substitutes for houses, are made in the
form of a cone, spread by the means of poles
spreading from a common centre, where there
was a hole at the top for the passage of the smoke.
These were often twenty feet in height, and as
many feet in diameter, where they were pinned
to the ground with stakes. In a large village
the Indians often had one lodge large enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
to hold fifty persons, and within were performed
their war dances around a fire made
in the centre. During the palmy days of the
British Fur Company, in a lodge like this only
made, instead, of birch-bark, Irving says the
Indians of the north held their "primitive
fairs," outside the city of Montreal, where they
disposed of their furs.</p>

<p>There was one drawback upon conviviality
for this party, in the extreme difficulty of getting
food for their animals; for the food and
fuel so abundant for themselves did not suffice
for their horses. Snow covered the ground,
and the trappers were obliged to gather willow
twigs, and strip the bark from cottonwood
trees, in order to keep them alive. The inner
bark of the cottonwood is eaten by the
Indians when reduced to extreme want. Beside,
the cold brought the buffalo down upon
them in large herds, to share the nourishment
they had provided for their horses.</p>

<p>Spring at length opened, and gladly they
again commenced trapping; first on the Yellowstone,
and soon on the head waters of the
Missouri, where they learned that the Blackfeet
were recovered from the sickness of last
year, which had not been so severe as it was
reported, and that they were still anxious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
in condition for a fight, and were encamped
not far from their present trapping grounds.</p>

<p>Carson and five men went forward in advance
"to reconnoitre," and found the village
preparing to remove, having learned of the
presence of the trappers. Hurrying back, a
party of forty-three was selected from the
whole, and they unanimously selected Carson
to lead them, and leaving the rest to move on
with the baggage, and aid them if it should be
necessary when they should come up with the
Indians, they hastened forward, eager for a
battle.</p>

<p>Carson and his command were not long in
overtaking the Indians, and dashing among
them, at the first fire killed ten of their braves,
but the Indians rallied, and retreated in good
order. The white men were in fine spirits,
and followed up their first attack with deadly
result for three full hours, the Indians making
scarce any resistance. Now their firing became
less animated as their ammunition was
getting low, and they had to use it with extreme
caution. The Indians, suspecting this from the
slackness of their fire, rallied, and with a tremendous
whoop turned upon their enemies.</p>

<p>Now Carson and his company could use
their small arms, which produced a terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
effect, and which enabled them again to drive
back the Indians. They rallied yet again, and
charged with so much power, and in such
numbers, they forced the trappers to retreat.</p>

<p>During this engagement, the horse of one
of the mountaineers was killed, and fell with
his whole weight upon his rider. Carson saw
the condition of the man, with six warriors
rushing to take his scalp, and reached the spot
in time to save his friend. Leaping from the
saddle, he placed himself before his fallen
companion, shouting at the same time for his
men to rally around him, and with deadly aim
from his rifle, shot down the foremost warrior.</p>

<p>The trappers now rallied about Carson, and
the remaining five warriors retired, without
the scalp of their fallen foe. Only two of them
reached a place of safety; for the well aimed
fire of the trappers leveled them with the
earth.</p>

<p>Carson's horse was loose, and as his comrade
was safe, he mounted behind one of his men,
and rode back to the ranks, while, by general
impulse, the firing upon both sides ceased.
His horse was captured and restored to him,
but each party, now thoroughly exhausted,
seemed to wait for the other to renew the attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
While resting in this attitude, the other
division of the trappers came in sight, but the
Indians, showing no fear, posted themselves
among the rocks at some distance from the
scene of the last skirmish, and coolly waited
for their adversaries. Exhausted ammunition
had been the cause of the retreat of Carson and
his force, but now with a renewed supply, and
an addition of fresh men to the force, they advanced
on foot to drive the Indians from their
hiding places. The contest was desperate and
severe, but powder and ball eventually conquered,
and the Indians, once dislodged, scattered
in every direction. The trappers considered
this a complete victory over the Blackfeet,
for a large number of their warriors were
killed, and many more were wounded, while
they had but three men killed, and a few severely
wounded.</p>

<p>Fontenelle and his party now camped at the
scene of the engagement, to recruit their men,
and bury here their dead. Afterward they
trapped through the whole Blackfeet country,
and with great success; going where they
pleased without fear or molestation. The Indians
kept off their <i>route</i>, evidently having acquaintance
with Carson and his company
enough to last them their life time. With the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
small-pox and the white man's rifles the warriors
were much reduced, and the tribe which
had formerly numbered thirty thousand, was
already decimated, and a few more blows, like
the one dealt by this dauntless band, would
suffice to break its spirit, and destroy its power
for future evil.</p>

<p>During the battle with the trappers, the
women and children of the Blackfeet village
were sent on in advance, and when the engagement
was over, and the braves returned to them
so much reduced in numbers, and without a
single scalp, the big lodge that had been erected
for the war dance, was given up for the wounded,
and in hundreds of Indian hearts grew a bitterer
hatred for the white man.</p>

<p>An express, despatched for the purpose, announced
the place of the rendezvous to Fontenelle
and Carson, who were now on Green
River, and with their whole party and a large
stock of furs, they at once set out for the place
upon Mud River, to find the sales commenced
before their arrival, so that in twenty days
they were ready to break up camp.</p>

<p>Carson now organized a party of seven, and
proceeded to a trading post called Brown's
Hole, where he joined a company of traders to
go to the Navajoe Indians. He found this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
tribe more assimilated to the white man than
any Indians he had yet seen, having many fine
horses and large flocks of sheep and cattle.
They also possessed the art of weaving, and
their blankets were in great demand through
Mexico, bringing high prices, on account of
their great beauty, being woven in flowers with
much taste. They were evidently a remnant
of the Aztec race.</p>

<p>They traded here for a large drove of fine
mules, which, taken to the fort on the South
Platte, realized good prices, when Carson went
again to Brown's Hole, a narrow but pretty
valley about sixteen miles long, upon the Colorado
River.</p>

<p>After many offers for his services from other
parties, Carson at length engaged himself for
the winter, to hunt for the men at this fort, and
as the game was abundant in this beautiful
valley, and in the cañon country further down
the Colorado, in its deer, elk, and antelope, reminding
him of his hunts upon the Sacramento,
the task was a delightful one to him.</p>

<p>In the spring, Carson trapped with Bridger
and Owen's with passable success, and went to
the rendezvous upon Wind River, at the head
of the Yellowstone, and from thence, with a
large part of the trappers at the rendezvous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to the Yellowstone, where they camped in the
vicinity for the winter, without seeing their old
enemy, the Blackfeet Indians, until mid-winter,
when they discovered that they were
near their principal stronghold.</p>

<p>A party of forty was selected to give them
battle, with Carson, of course, for their captain.
They found the Indians already in the field, to
the number of several hundred, who made a
brave resistance, until night and darkness admonished
both parties to retire. In the morning
when Carson and his men went to the spot
whither the Indians had retired, they were
not to be found. They had given them a "wide
berth," taking their all away with them, even
their dead.</p>

<p>Carson and his command returned to camp,
where a council of war decided that as the Indians
would report, at the principal encampment,
the terrible loss they had sustained, and
others would be sent to renew the fight, it was
wise to prepare to act on the defensive, and
use every precaution immediately; and accordingly
a sentinel was stationed on a lofty hill
near by, who soon reported that the Indians
were upon the move.</p>

<p>Their plans matured, they at once threw up
a breastwork, under Carson's direction, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
waited the approach of the Indians, who came
in slowly, the first parties waiting for those
behind. After three days, a full thousand had
reached the camp, about half a mile from the
breastwork of the trappers. In their war
paint&mdash;stripes of red across the forehead, and
down either cheek&mdash;with their bows and arrows,
tomahawks, and lances, this army of Indians
presented a formidable appearance to
the small body of trappers who were opposed
to them.</p>

<p>The war dance was enacted in sight and
hearing of the trappers, and at early dawn the
Indians advanced, having made every preparation
for the attack. Carson commanded his
men to reserve their fire till the Indians were
near enough to have every shot tell; but seeing
the strength of the white men's position,
after a few ineffectual shots, the Indians retired,
camped a mile from them, and finally
separated into two parties, and went away,
leaving the trappers to breathe more freely,
for, at the best, the encounter must have been
of a desperate character.</p>

<p>They evidently recognized the leader who
had before dealt so severely with them, in the
skill with which the defence was arranged, and
if the name of Kit Carson was on their lips,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
they knew him for both bravery and magnanimity,
and had not the courage to offer him
battle.</p>

<p>Another winter gone, saddlery, moccasin-making,
lodge-building, to complete the repairs
of the summer's wars and the winter's fight,
all completed, Carson with fifteen men went,
past Fort Hall, again to the Salmon River,
and trapped part of the season there and upon
Big Snake, and Goose Creeks, and selling his
furs at Fort Hall, again joined Bridger in another
trapping excursion into the Blackfeet
country.</p>

<p>The Blackfeet had molested the traps of another
party who had arrived there before them,
and had driven them away. The Indian assailants
were still near, and Carson led his
party against them, taking care to station himself
and men in the edge of a thicket, where
they kept the savages at bay all day, taking a
man from their number with nearly every
shot of their well directed rifles. In vain the
Indians now attempted to fire the thicket; it
would not burn, and sullenly they retired,
forced again to acknowledge defeat at the
hands of Kit Carson, the "Monarch of the
Prairies."</p>

<p>Carson's party now joined with the others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
but concluding that they could not trap successfully
with the annoyance the Indians were
likely to give them, as their force was too
small to hope to conquer, they left this part of
the country for the north fork of the Missouri.</p>

<p>Now they were with the friendly Flatheads,
one of whose chiefs joined them in the hunt,
and went into camp near them, with a party of
his braves. This tribe of Indians, like several
other tribes which extend along this latitude
to the Pacific, have the custom which gives
them their name, thus described by Irving, in
speaking of the Indians upon the Lower Columbia,
about its mouth.</p>

<p>"A most singular custom," he says, "prevails,
not only among the Chinooks, but among
most of the tribes about this part of the coast,
which is the flattening of the forehead. The
process by which this deformity is effected,
commences immediately after birth. The infant
is laid in a wooden trough, by way of cradle.
The end on which the head reposes is
higher than the rest. A padding is placed
on the forehead of the infant, with a piece of
bark above it, and is pressed down by cords
which pass through holes upon the sides
of the trough. As the tightening of the
padding and the pressure of the head to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
board is gradual, the process is said not to be
attended with pain. The appearance of the
infant, however, while in this state of compression
is whimsically hideous, and 'its little
black eyes,' we are told, 'being forced out by
the tightness of the bandages, resemble those
of a mouse choked in a trap.'</p>

<p>"About a year's pressure is sufficient to produce
the desired effect, at the end of which
time, the child emerges from its bandages, a
complete flathead, and continues so through
life. It must be noted, however, that this
flattening of the head has something in it of
aristocratic significance, like the crippling of
the feet among the Chinese ladies of quality.
At any rate, it is the sign of freedom. No
slave is permitted to bestow this deformity
upon the head of his children; all the slaves,
therefore, are roundheads."</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p>In the spring, Kit Carson proposed a different
plan of operations; he went to hunt on the
streams in the vicinage of his winter's camp
with only a single companion. The Utah Indians,
into whose country he came, were also
friends of Carson, and, unmolested in his business,
his efforts were crowned with abundant
success. He took his furs to Robideau fort,
and with a party of five went to Grand River,
and thence to Brown's Hole on Green River
for the winter.</p>

<p>In the following spring he went to the Utah
country, to the streams that flow into Great
Salt Lake on the South, which was rich in furs
and of exceeding beauty, with the points of
grand old snow mountains ever in sight,
around him.</p>

<p>From here he went to the New Fork, and as
it was afterward described by a party for whom
Carson was the guide, we shall not give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
description at this point of our narrative.
Again he trapped among the Utahs, and disposed
of his furs at Robideau Fort; but now
the prices did not please him. Beaver fur was
at a discount, and the trade of the trapper becoming
unprofitable.</p>

<p>Baird, in his general report upon mammals,
uses the following language, which is appropriate
in this connection:</p>

<p>"The beaver once inhabited all of the globe
lying in the northern temperate zone; yet
from Europe, China, and all the eastern portion
of the United States, it has been entirely
exterminated, and a war so universal and relentless
has been waged upon this defenceless
animal, his great intelligence has been so generally
opposed by the intelligence of man,
it has seemed certain, unless some kind providence
should interpose, that the castor, like
its congener, the Castorides, would soon be
found only in a fossil state.</p>

<p>"Happily that providence did interpose,
through a certain ingenious somebody, who
first suggested the use of silk in the place of
fur for the covering of hats. The beaver were
not yet exterminated from Western America,
and now, since they are not "worth killing,"
in those inhospitable regions, where there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
no encouragement for American enterprise or
cupidity, we may hope that the beaver will
there retain existence, in a home exclusively
their own.</p>

<p>"The price of beaver skins has so much
diminished that they were offered to some of
the party at twenty-five cents by the bale."</p>

<p>Carson had pursued the business of trapping
for eight years, and his life had been one
of unceasing toil, of extreme hardship, full
of danger, yet withal full of interest. More
than this, while the lack of early scientific
training had prevented him from making that
record of his travels, which would have given
the world the benefit of his explorations, he
had treasured in his memory the knowledge
of localities, of their conditions, and seasons,
and advantages, which in the good time coming,
would enable him to associate his labors with
another, who possessed the scientific attainments
which Carson lacked, and who with
Carson's invaluable assistance would come to
be known world wide as a bold explorer, and
who, but for Carson's experience, where such
experience was a chief requisite to success,
might have failed in his first efforts in the
grand enterprise entrusted to him.</p>

<p>Carson knew the general features of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
country, its mountains, plains, and rivers, and
the minor points of animal and vegetable productions,
from the head waters of the "monarch
of rivers," to the mouth of the Colorado,
and from the southern Arkansas to the Columbia,
better, perhaps, than any one living,
though yet but twenty-five years of age.</p>

<p>We left Carson at Robideau Fort, tired of
the pursuit of trapping, as soon as it had become
unprofitable, and while there, he arranged
with three or four other trappers, to come
down to Bent's Fort. The trip was like others
made at this season, through a country where
the rifle would supply food for the party, and
arriving at Bent's Fort, where his name was
already well-known, Carson could not long be
idle. He engaged himself to Messrs. Bent
and St. Vrain, as hunter to the fort, preferring
this by far to the idea of seeking employment
nearer civilized life. Indeed no situation
could have pleased him better, if we may
judge from the fact that he continued in it for
eight years, and until the connection with his
employers was broken by the death of one of
the partners, Col. Bent.</p>

<p>Gov. Bent, since appointed to the office of
chief magistrate of New Mexico, by the United
States Government, had been killed by Mexican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Indians, and was universally mourned by
Americans and Indians wherever he was
known. Mr. St. Vrain, the other partner, was
active during the Mexican war, since the date
of which we write, still lives, and is esteemed,
as a father, by many an early mountaineer.
Carson owed him gratitude for kindly sympathy
and words of counsel, when yet a youth he
was commencing his mountain life, and Dr.
Peters, the first biographer of Kit Carson,
dedicates his book to Col. St. Vrain, asserting
that he was the first to discover and direct
Carson's talents to the path in which they were
employed. For both of these gentlemanly
proprietors, Carson cherished a warm friendship,
nor was there ever an unpleasant occurrence
between them.</p>

<p>When game was plenty, he supplied the
forty mouths to be filled with ease, but when
it was scarce, his task was sometimes difficult,
but skill and experience enabled him to
triumph over every obstacle.</p>

<p>It is not strange that with such long experience
Carson became the most skillful of hunters,
and won the name of the "Nestor of the
Rocky Mountains." Among the Indians he
had earned the undisputed title of "Monarch
of the Prairies."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
But while he killed thousands of elk, deer,
and antelope, nor disdained the rabbit and the
grouse, and took the wild goose on the wing,
of all the game of beast or bird, he liked the
best to hunt the buffalo, for there was an excitement
in the chase of that noble animal
which aroused his spirits to the highest pitch
of excitement.</p>

<p>Assuredly, Christopher Carson's <i>is</i> "a life
out of the usual routine, and checkered with
adventures which have sorely tested the courage
and endurance of this wonderful man."
Col. St. Vrain, in the preface to Peters' Life
of Carson, says,</p>

<p>"Entering upon his life work at the age of
seventeen, choosing now to think for himself,
nor follow the lead of those who would detain
him in a quiet life, while he felt the restless
fire 'in his bones,' that forbade his burying his
energy in merely mechanical toil, he had yet
been directed in his choice, by the fitness for
it the pursuits of youth had given, and spurning
the humdrum monotony of the shop, gave
himself entirely to what would most aid him
in attaining the profession he had chosen. We
must admire such spirit in a youth, for it augurs
well for the energy and will power of the
manhood; therefore, when the biographer says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of Christopher Carson, that the neighbors who
knew him, predicted an uncommon life in the
child with whom they hunted, and conceded to
him positions, as well as privileges, that were
not accorded to common men, with his life till
thirty-three before us, we feel that he has fulfilled
the hope of early promise, with a noble
manhood."</p>

<p>We have followed Carson's pathway, without
much of detail, to the localities where he
practised the profession he had chosen, until
we saw him leave it because it ceased longer
to afford compensation for his toil, and during
as long a period we have written of his
quiet pursuit of the, to him, pleasant, but laborious
life of a hunter; unless we must class
the latter eight years with the former, and
assume each as a part of the profession he had
chosen.</p>

<p>In all, with perhaps the exception of a few
weeks at Santa Fe, when still in his minority,
we have found him ever strong to resist the
thousand temptations to evil with which his
pathway was beset, and which drew other men
away. Strong ever in the maintenance of the
integrity of his manhood, even when the convivial
circle and the game had a brief fascination
for him, they taught him the lesson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
which he needed to learn, that only by earnest
resistance, can evil be overcome; and thus he
was enabled to admonish others against those
temptations which had once overcome even
his powers of resistance; and so he learned to
school himself to the idea, that good comes
ever through the temptation to evil to all
those who have the courage to extract it.</p>

<p>We have followed him up and down all the
streams of our great central western wilds, and
indicated the store of geographic knowledge
which he had acquired by hard experience before
they were known so far to any one besides;
and then for eight years more we have
seen that this knowledge was digested and reviewed
in the social circle with other mountain
trappers, and beside the lonely mountain
river, and 'neath the wild, steep cliff; or on
the grassy bottom, or the barren plain, and in
the less sterile places where the sage hen found
a covert, and up among the oak openings, and
in the gigantic parks, where, as a hunter, he
revisited old haunts.</p>

<p>In all his toilsome and adventurous enterprises,
while he sought to benefit himself, he
never turned away, nor failed to lend a helping
hand to a needy, suffering brother, or to
encourage one who needed such a lesson, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
turn his youth to the most account; and if affectionate
regard is a recompense for such service,
he had his compensation, as he passed along
the path he had marked out for himself, not
from the white man alone, but from the Indian
who everywhere came to look upon Kit
Carson as his friend.</p>

<p>The Camanches, the Arapahoes, the Utahs,
and the Cheyennes, besides several smaller
tribes, knew him personally in the hunt, and
he had sat by their camp fires, and dandled
their children, and sung to them the ditty,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"What makes the lamb love Mary so?</div>
<div class="indent2">The eager children cry;</div>
<div class="line">Why Mary loves the lamb, you know,</div>
<div class="indent2">And that's the reason why."</div>
</div></div>

<p>The Indians feared, and reverenced, and
loved him, and that this latter may be proved
to the reader we relate the following story of
private history, nor will it be esteemed out of
taste:</p>

<p>The powerful Sioux had come from the
north beyond their usual hunting grounds,
and had had skirmishes with several Indian
bands, some of whom sent for Carson to the
Upper Arkansas to come over and help them
drive back the Sioux. As the larder at the
fort was full, he consented to go with the war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>-painted
Camanche messengers to a camp of
their tribe, united with a band of Arapahoes.
They told him the Sioux had a thousand warriors
and many rifles, and they feared them,
but knew that the "Monarch of the Prairies"
could overcome them. Carson sat in council
with the chiefs, and finally, instead of encouraging
them to fight, persuaded them to peace,
and acted so successfully the part of mediator,
that the Sioux consented to retire from the
hunting grounds of the Camanches when the
season was over, and they separated without a
collision.</p>

<p>It was while engaged as hunter for Messrs.
Bent and St. Vrain, Carson took to himself an
Indian wife, by whom he had a daughter still
living, and who forms the connecting link between
his past hardships, and his present
greatness; for that he is emphatically a great
man, the whole civilized world has acknowledged.</p>

<p>The mother died soon after her birth, and
Carson feeling that his rude cabin was scarcely
the place to rear his child, determined, when
of a suitable age, to take her to St. Louis, and
secure for her those advantages of education
which circumstances had denied to him; and
accordingly, when his engagement at the fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
had expired, he determined to go to St. Louis
for that purpose, embracing on the route the
opportunity of visiting the home of his boyhood,
which he had not seen for sixteen years.</p>

<p>Of course he found everything changed.
Many of those whom he had known as men
and heads of families, were now grown old,
while more had died off; but by those to whom
he was made known, he was recognized with a
heartiness of welcome which brought tears to
his eyes, though his heart was saddened at the
changes which time had wrought. His fame
had preceded him, and his welcome was therefore
doubly cordial, for he had more than verified
the promise of his youth.</p>

<p>Thence he proceeded to St. Louis, with the
intention of placing his daughter at school, but
here, to his great amazement, he found himself
a lion; for the advent of such a man in such a
city, which had so often rung with his deeds
of daring and suffering, could not be permitted
to remain among its citizens unknown
or unrecognized. He was courted and fêted
and though gratified at the attentions showered
upon him, found himself so thoroughly out of
his element, that he longed to return to more
pleasant and more familiar scenes, his old
hunting grounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Having accomplished the object of his visit
to St. Louis, in placing his daughter under
proper guardianship, he left the city, carrying
with him pleasing, because merited remembrances
of the attentions paid to him, and
leaving behind him impressions of the most
favorable character.</p>

<p>Soon after he reached St. Louis, he had the
good fortune to fall in with Lieut. Fremont,
who was there organizing a party for the exploration
of the far western country, as yet
unknown, and who was anxiously awaiting the
arrival of Captain Drips, a well known trader
and trapper, who had been highly recommended
to him as a guide.</p>

<p>Kit Carson's name and fame were familiar
as household words to Fremont, and he gladly
availed himself of his proffered services in
lieu of those of Capt. Drips. It did not take
long for two such men as John C. Fremont
and Kit Carson to become thoroughly acquainted
with each other, and the accidental
meeting at St. Louis resulted in the cementing
of a friendship which has never been impaired,&mdash;won
as it was on the one part by fidelity,
truthfulness, integrity, and courage, united to
vast experience and consummate skill in the
prosecution of the duty he had assumed&mdash;on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
other by every quality which commands honour,
regard, esteem, and high personal devotion.</p>

<p>And now Carson's life has commenced in
earnest, for heretofore he has only been fitting
himself to live. His name is embodied in the
archives of our country's history, and no one
has been more ready to accord to him the credit
he so well earned, as has he who had the good
fortune to secure, at the same time, the services
of the most experienced guide of his day, and
the devotion of a friend.</p>

<p>Lieut. Fremont had instructions to explore
and report upon the country lying between
the frontiers of Missouri and the South Pass
in the Rocky Mountains, on the line of the
Kansas and Great Platte Rivers, and with his
party, leaving St. Louis on the 22nd of May,
1842, by steamboat for Chouteau's Landing
on the Missouri, near the mouth of the Kansas,
at a point twelve miles beyond at Chouteau's
trading post, he encamped there to complete
his arrangements for this important expedition.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p>Fremont was delayed several days at Chouteau's
Landing, by the state of the weather,
which prevented the necessary astronomical
observations, but finally all his arrangements
being completed, and the weather permitting,
the party started in the highest spirit, and
filled with anticipations of an exciting and adventurous
journey.</p>

<p>He had collected in the neighborhood of St.
Louis twenty-one men, principally Creole and
Canadian <i>voyageurs</i>, who had become familiar
with prairie life in the service of the fur companies
in the Indian country. Mr. Charles
Preuss, a native of Germany, was his assistant
in the topographical part of the survey. L.
Maxwell, of Kaskaskia, had been engaged as
hunter, and Christopher Carson as guide.</p>

<p>Mr. Cyprian Chouteau, to whose kindness,
during their stay at his house, all were much
indebted, accompanied them several miles on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
their way, until they met an Indian, whom he
had engaged to conduct them on the first thirty
or forty miles, where he was to consign them
to the ocean prairie, which stretched, without
interruption, almost to the base of the Rocky
Mountains.</p>

<p>During the journey, it was the customary
practice to encamp an hour or two before sunset,
when the carts were disposed so as to form
a sort of barricade around a circle some eighty
yards in diameter. The tents were pitched,
and the horses hobbled and turned loose to
graze; and but a few minutes elapsed before
the cooks of the messes, of which there were
four, were busily engaged in preparing the
evening meal. At nightfall, the horses, mules,
and oxen, were driven in and picketed&mdash;that
is, secured by a halter, of which one end was
tied to a small steel-shod picket, and driven into
the ground; the halter being twenty or thirty
feet long, which enabled them to obtain a little
food during the night. When they had
reached a part of the country where such a
precaution became necessary, the carts being
regularly arranged for defending the camp,
guard was mounted at eight o'clock, consisting
of three men, who were relieved every two
hours; the morning watch being horse guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
for the day. At daybreak, the camp was
roused, the animals turned loose to graze, and
breakfast generally over between six and
seven o'clock, when they resumed their march,
making regularly a halt at noon for one or
two hours. Such was usually the order of the
day, except when accident of country forced
a variation, which, however, happened but
rarely.</p>

<p>They reached the ford of the Kansas late in
the afternoon of the 14th, where the river was
two hundred and thirty yards wide, and commenced
immediately preparations for crossing.
The river had been swollen by the late rains,
and was sweeping by with an angry current,
yellow and turbid as the Missouri. Up to
this point, the road traveled was a remarkably
fine one, well beaten and level&mdash;the usual
road of a prairie country. By this route, the
ford was one hundred miles from the mouth
of the Kansas river, on reaching which several
mounted men led the way into the stream, to
swim across. The animals were driven in after
them, and in a few minutes all had reached
the opposite bank in safety, with the exception
of the oxen, which swam some distance down
the river, and, returning to the right bank,
were not got over until the next morning. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the meantime, the carts had been unloaded
and dismantled, and an India-rubber boat,
which had been brought for the survey of the
Platte River, placed in the water. The boat
was twenty feet long and five broad, and on it
were placed the body and wheels of a cart,
with the load belonging to it, and three men
with paddles.</p>

<p>The velocity of the current, and the inconvenient
freight, rendering it difficult to be
managed, Basil Lajeunesse, one of the best
swimmers, took in his teeth a line attached to
the boat, and swam ahead in order to reach a
footing as soon as possible, and assist in drawing
her over. In this manner, six passages
had been successfully made, and as many carts
with their contents, and a greater portion of the
party, deposited on the left bank; but night
was drawing near, and in his great anxiety to
complete the crossing before darkness set in,
he put on the boat, contrary to the advice of
Carson, the last two carts with their loads.
The consequence was, the boat was capsized,
and everything on board was in a moment
floating down stream. They were all, however,
eventually recovered, but not without
great trouble. Carson and Maxwell, who had
been in the water nearly all the succeeding day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
searching for the lost articles, were taken so
ill in consequence of the prolonged exposure,
the party was obliged to lie by another day to
enable them to recruit, for to proceed without
them would have been folly.</p>

<p>The dense timber which surrounded their
camp, interfering with astronomical observations,
and the wet and damaged stores requiring
exposure to the sun, the tents were struck
early the next day but one after this disaster
and the party moved up the river about seven
miles, where they camped upon a handsome
open prairie, some twenty feet above the
water, and where the fine grass afforded a luxurious
repast to the weary animals. They lay
in camp here two days, during which time the
men were kept busy in drying the provisions,
painting the cart covers, and otherwise completing
their equipage, until the afternoon
when powder was distributed to them, and
they spent some hours in firing at a mark, as
they were now fairly in the Indian country,
and it began to be time to prepare for the
chances of the wilderness.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p>Leaving the river bottom, the road which
was the Oregon trail, past Fort Laramie,&mdash;ran
along the uplands, over a rolling country,
upon which were scattered many boulders of
red sand-stone, some of them of several tons
weight; and many beautiful plants and flowers
enlivened the prairie. The barometer indicated
fourteen hundred feet above the level of
the sea, and the elevation appeared to have its
influence on vegetation.</p>

<p>The country became more broken, rising
still and covered everywhere with fragments
of silicious limestone, strewn over the earth
like pebbles on the sea shore; especially upon
the summits and exposed situations; and in
these places but few plants grew, while in the
creek bottoms, and ravines, a great variety of
plants flourished.</p>

<p>For several days they continued their journey,
annoyed only by the lack of water, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
at length reached the range of the Pawnees
who infested that part of the country, stealing
horses from companies on their way to the
mountains, and when in sufficient force, openly
attacking them, and subjecting them to various
insults; and it was while encamped here, that
a regular guard was mounted for the first time,
but the night passed over without annoyance.</p>

<p>Speaking of the constant watchfulness required
when in the neighborhood of hostile or
thieving Indians, Fremont says,</p>

<p>"The next morning we had a specimen of
the false alarms to which all parties in these
wild regions are subject. Proceeding up the
valley, objects were seen on the opposite hills,
which disappeared before a glass could be
brought to bear upon them. A man, who was
a short distance in the rear, came spurring up
in great haste, shouting, Indians! Indians!
He had been near enough to see and count
them, according to his report, and had made
out twenty-seven. I immediately halted; arms
were examined and put in order; the usual
preparations made; and Kit Carson, springing
upon one of the hunting horses, crossed the
river, and galloped off into the opposite
prairies, to obtain some certain intelligence of
their movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
"Mounted on a fine horse, without a saddle,
and scouring bareheaded over the prairies, Kit
was one of the finest pictures of a horseman I
have ever seen. A short time enabled him to
discover that the Indian war party of twenty-seven
consisted of six elk, who had been
gazing curiously at our caravan as it passed
by, and were now scampering off at full speed.
This was our first alarm, and its excitement
broke agreeably on the monotony of the day.
At our noon halt, the men were exercised at a
target; and in the evening we pitched our
tents at a Pawnee encampment of last July.
They had apparently killed buffalo here, as
many bones were lying about, and the frames
where the hides had been stretched were yet
standing."</p>

<p>Leaving the fork of the "Blue," upon a high
dividing ridge, in about twenty-one miles they
reached the coast of the Platte, or Nebraska
River as it is called, a line of low hills, or the
break from the prairie to the river bottom.
Cacti here were numerous, and the <i>amorpha</i>,
remarkable for its large and luxuriant purple
clusters, was in full bloom. From the foot of
the coast, two miles across the level bottom,
brought them to the shore of the river twenty
miles below the head of Grand Island, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
more than three hundred from the mouth of the
Kansas. The elevation of the Platte valley
here was about two thousand feet above the
level of the sea.</p>

<p>The next day they met a party of fourteen,
who had started sixty days before from Fort
Laramie, in barges laden with furs for the
American Fur Company, hoping to come down
the Platte without difficulty, as they left upon
the annual flood, and their boats drew only
nine inches of water. But at Scott's bluffs,
one hundred and thirty miles below Fort Laramie,
the river became so broad and shallow,
and the current so changeful among the sandbars,
that they abandoned their boats and
<i>cached</i> their cargoes, and were making the rest
of their journey to St. Louis on foot, each with
a pack as large as he could carry.</p>

<p>In the interchange of news, and the renewal
of old acquaintanceships, they found
wherewithal to fill a busy hour. Among
them Fremont had found an old companion
on the northern prairie, a hardened and hardly
served veteran of the mountains, who had
been as much hacked and scarred as an old
<i>moustache</i> of Napoleon's "old guard." He
flourished in the sobriquet of La Tulipe, and his
real name no one knew. Finding that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
going to the States only because his company
was bound in that direction, and that he was
rather more willing to return with Fremont,
he was taken again into his service.</p>

<p>A few days more of travel, whose monotony
was not relieved by any incident worth narrating,
brought the party in sight of the buffalo,
swarming in immense numbers over the
plains, where they had left scarcely a blade of
grass standing. "Mr. Preuss," says Fremont,
"who was sketching at a little distance in the
rear, had at first noted them as large groves
of timber. In the sight of such a mass of life,
the traveler feels a strange emotion of grandeur.
We had heard from a distance a dull
and confused murmuring, and when we came
in view of their dark masses, there was not
one among us who did not feel his heart beat
quicker. It was the early part of the day,
when the herds are feeding; and everywhere
they were in motion. Here and there a huge
old bull was rolling in the grass, and clouds
of dust rose in the air from various parts of
the bands, each the scene of some obstinate
fight. Indians and buffalo make the poetry
and life of the prairie, and our camp was full
of their exhilaration. In place of the quiet
monotony of the march, relieved only by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
cracking of the whip, and an '<i>avance donc! enfant
de garce!</i>' shouts and songs resounded
from every part of the line, and our evening
camp was always the commencement of a feast,
which terminated only with our departure on
the following morning. At any time in the
night might be seen pieces of the most delicate
meat, roasting <i>en appolas</i>, on sticks around the
fire, and the guard were never without company.
With pleasant weather, and no enemy
to fear, an abundance of the most excellent
meat, and no scarcity of bread or tobacco, they
were enjoying the oasis of a voyageur's life."</p>

<p>Three cows were killed on that day, but a
serious accident befell Carson in the course of
the chase, which had nearly cost him his life.
Kit had shot one, and was continuing the
chase, in the midst of another herd, when his
horse fell headlong, but sprang up and joined
the flying band. Though considerably hurt,
he had the good fortune to break no bones;
and Maxwell, who was mounted on a fleet
hunter, captured the runaway after a hard
chase. He was on the point of shooting him,
to avoid the loss of his bridle, (a handsomely
mounted Spanish one,) when he found that his
horse was able to come up with him.</p>

<p>This mishap, however, did not deter Kit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
from his favorite pursuit of buffalo hunting,
for on the following day, notwithstanding his
really serious accident, we find him ready and
eager for another chase. Fremont in his narrative
thus relates the occurrence:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As we were riding quietly along the bank,
a grand herd of buffalo, some seven or eight
hundred in number, came crowding up from
the river, where they had been to drink, and
commenced crossing the plain slowly, eating
as they went. The wind was favorable; the
coolness of the morning invited to exercise;
the ground was apparently good, and the distance
across the prairie (two or three miles)
gave us a fine opportunity to charge them before
they could get among the river hills. It
was too fine a prospect for a chase to be lost;
and halting for a few moments, the hunters
were brought up and saddled, and Kit Carson,
Maxwell, and I, started together. They were
now somewhat less than half a mile distant,
and we rode easily along until within about
three hundred yards, when a sudden agitation,
a wavering in the band, and a galloping to
and fro of some which were scattered along
the skirts, gave us the intimation that we
were discovered. We started together at a
hard gallop, riding steadily abreast of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
other, and here the interest of the chase became
so engrossingly intense, that we were sensible
to nothing else. We were now closing
upon them rapidly, and the front of the mass
was already in rapid motion for the hills, and
in a few seconds the movement had communicated
itself to the whole herd.</p>

<p>"A crowd of bulls, as usual, brought up the
rear, and every now and then some of them
faced about, and then dashed on after the band
a short distance, and turned and looked again,
as if more than half inclined to stand and
fight. In a few moments, however, during
which we had been quickening our pace, the
rout was universal, and we were going over
the ground like a hurricane. When at about
thirty yards, we gave the usual shout (the
hunter's <i>pas de charge</i>), and broke into the
herd. We entered on the side, the mass giving
way in every direction in their heedless
course. Many of the bulls, less active and
less fleet than the cows, paying no attention to
the ground, and occupied solely with the hunter,
were precipitated to the earth with great
force, rolling over and over with the violence
of the shock, and hardly distinguishable
in the dust. We separated on entering, each
singling out his game.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
"My horse was a trained hunter, famous in
the west under the name of Proveau, and with
his eyes flashing, and the foam flying from
his mouth, sprang on after the cow like a
tiger. In a few moments he brought me
alongside of her, and rising in the stirrups, I
fired at the distance of a yard, the ball entering
at the termination of the long hair, and
passing near the heart. She fell headlong at
the report of the gun, and, checking my horse,
I looked around for my companions.</p>

<p>"At a little distance, Kit was on the ground,
engaged in tying his horse to the horns of a
cow which he was preparing to cut up. Among
the scattered bands, at some distance below, I
caught a glimpse of Maxwell; and while I was
looking, a light wreath of white smoke curled
away from his gun, from which I was too far
to hear the report. Nearer, and between me
and the hills, towards which they were directing
their course, was the body of the herd, and
giving my horse the rein, we dashed after
them. A thick cloud of dust hung upon their
rear, which filled my mouth and eyes, and
nearly smothered me. In the midst of this I
could see nothing, and the buffalo were not
distinguishable until within thirty feet.</p>

<p>"They crowded together more densely still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
as I came upon them, and rushed along in
such a compact body, that I could not obtain
an entrance&mdash;the horse almost leaping upon
them. In a few moments the mass divided to
the right and left, the horns clattering with a
noise heard above everything else, and my
horse darted into the opening.</p>

<p>"Five or six bulls charged on us as we
dashed along the line, but were left far behind;
and singling out a cow, I gave her my
fire, but struck too high. She gave a tremendous
leap, and scoured on swifter than before.
I reined up my horse, and the band swept on
like a torrent, and left the place quiet and
clear. Our chase had led us into dangerous
ground. A prairie-dog village, so thickly settled
that there were three or four holes in every
twenty yards square, occupied the whole bottom
for nearly two miles in length. Looking
around, I saw only one of the hunters, nearly
out of sight, and the long dark line of our caravan
crawling along, three or four miles distant."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<p>The encampment of the party on the 4th
of July, was a few miles from where the road
crosses over to the north fork of the Platte,
where a grand dinner was prepared, toasts
drank, and salutes fired; and it was here Fremont
decided to divide his party, wishing, himself,
to explore the south fork of the Platte, as
far as St. Vrain's Fort; and taking with him
Maxwell and two others of his men, and the
Cheyenne Indians, whose village was upon
this river, he left the rest of the party to proceed
under the direction of Clement Lambert
up the north fork to Fort Laramie, where they
were to wait his arrival, as he intended to cross
the country between the two forts.</p>

<p>Buffalo were still plenty upon Fremont's
route, and the Indians with him made an unsuccessful
attempt to lasso the leader of a
drove of wild horses, which they passed. They
met a band of two or three hundred Arapahoe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Indians, and were only saved from an attack
by Maxwell, who secured a timely recognition
from the old chief who led the party, which
proved to be from a village among whom he
had resided as a trader, and whose camp the
chief pointed out to them some six miles distant.
They had come out to surround a band
of buffalo which was feeding across the river,
and were making a large circuit to avoid giving
them the wind, when they discovered Fremont's
party, whom they had mistaken for
Pawnees. In a few minutes the women came
galloping up, astride of their horses, and
naked from their knees down, and the hips up.
They followed the men to assist in cutting up
and carrying off the meat.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing directly across the
river, and the chief having requested Fremont
to remain where he then was, to avoid raising
the herd, he readily consented, and having unsaddled
their horses, they sat down to view the
scene. The day had become very hot, the thermometer
standing at 108°. The Indians commenced
crossing the river, and as soon as they
were upon the other side, separated into two
bodies.</p>

<p>Fremont thus describes this exciting hunt,
or massacre, as the reader may choose to designate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
it,&mdash;and his subsequent visit to the Arapahoe
village:</p>

<p>"One party proceeded directly across the
prairie, towards the hills, in an extended line,
while the other went up the river; and instantly,
as they had given the wind to the herd,
the chase commenced. The buffalo started for
the hills, but were intercepted and driven back
toward the river, broken and running in every
direction. The clouds of dust soon covered
the whole scene, preventing us from having
any but an occasional view. It had a very
singular appearance to us at a distance, especially
when looking with the glass.</p>

<p>"We were too far to hear the report of the
guns, or any sound, and at every instant,
through the clouds of dust, which the sun
made luminous, we could see for a moment
two or three buffalo dashing along, and close
behind them an Indian with his long spear,
or other weapon, and instantly again they
disappeared. The apparent silence, and the
dimly seen figures flitting by with such rapidity,
gave it a kind of dreamy effect, and
seemed more like a picture than a scene of
real life.</p>

<p>"It had been a large herd when the <i>cerne</i>
commenced, probably three or four hundred in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
number; but though I watched them closely,
I did not see one emerge from the fatal cloud
where the work of destruction was going on.
After remaining here about an hour, we resumed
our journey in the direction of the village.</p>

<p>"Gradually, as we rode on, Indian after Indian
came dropping along, laden with meat;
and by the time we had reached the lodges,
the backward road was covered with the returning
horsemen. It was a pleasant contrast
with the desert road we had been traveling.
Several had joined company with us, and one
of the chiefs invited us to his lodge.</p>

<p>"The village consisted of about one hundred
and twenty-five lodges, of which twenty
were Cheyennes; the latter pitched a little
apart from the Arapahoes. They were disposed
in a scattering manner on both sides of
a broad, irregular street, about one hundred
and fifty feet wide, and running along the river.
As we rode along, I remarked near some of
the lodges a kind of tripod frame, formed of
three slender poles of birch, scraped very
clean, to which were affixed the shield and
spear, with some other weapons of a chief. All
were scrupulously clean, the spear head was
burnished bright, and the shield white and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
stainless. It reminded me of the days of
feudal chivalry; and when, as I rode by, I
yielded to the passing impulse, and touched
one of the spotless shields with the muzzle of
my gun, I almost expected a grim warrior to
start from the lodge and resent my challenge.</p>

<p>"The master of the lodge spread out a robe
for me to sit upon, and the squaws set before
us a large wooden dish of buffalo meat. He
had lit his pipe in the meanwhile, and when it
had been passed around, we commenced our
dinner while he continued to smoke. Gradually,
five or six other chiefs came in, and took
their seats in silence. When we had finished,
our host asked a number of questions relative
to the object of our journey, of which I made
no concealment; telling him simply that I had
made a visit to see the country, preparatory to
the establishment of military posts on the way
to the mountains.</p>

<p>"Although this was information of the
highest interest to them, and by no means
calculated to please them, it excited no expression
of surprise, and in no way altered the
grave courtesy of their demeanor. The others
listened and smoked. I remarked, that in
taking the pipe for the first time, each had
turned the stem upward, with a rapid glance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
as in offering to the Great Spirit, before he put
it in his mouth."</p>

<p>Riding near the river, Fremont and Maxwell
had an interview with Jim Beckwith, who
had been chief of the Crow Indians, but had
left them some time before, and was now residing
in this river bottom, with his wife, a
Spanish woman from Taos. They also passed
a camp of four or five New Englanders, with
Indian wives&mdash;a party of independent trappers,
and reached St. Vrain's Fort on the evening
of July 10th, where they were hospitably
entertained by Mr. St. Vrain, and received
from him such needed assistance as he was
able to render. Maxwell was at home here,
as he had spent the last two or three years between
the fort and Taos.</p>

<p>On the evening of the fifteenth, they arrived
at Fort Laramie, a post of the American Fur
Company, near the junction of the Laramie
Creek with the Platte River, which had quite
a military appearance, with its lofty walls
whitewashed and picketed, and large bastions
at the angles. A cluster of lodges belonging
to the Sioux Indians was pitched under the
walls. He was received with great hospitality
by the gentleman in charge of the fort, Mr.
Boudeau, having letters of introduction to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
from the company at St. Louis, and it is hardly
necessary to say that he was hospitably received
and most kindly treated. He found
Carson with the party under his command
camped on the bank near the fort, by whom
they were most warmly welcomed, and in the
enjoyment of a bountiful supper, which coffee
and bread converted almost into a luxury,
they forgot the toils and sufferings of the past
ten days.</p>

<p>The news brought by Mr. Preuss, who it
will be remembered was with Carson's party,
was as exciting as it was unpleasant. He had
learned that the Sioux who had been badly
disposed, had now broken out into open hostility,
and his informant, a well known trapper,
named Bridger, had been attacked by them,
and had only defeated them after serious losses
on both sides. United with the Cheyennes
and Gros Ventre Indians, they were scouring
the country in war parties, declaring war upon
every living thing which should pass the <i>Red
Buttes</i>; their special hostility being, however, directed
against the white men. In fact the country
was swarming with hostile Indians, and it
was but too evident that any party who should
attempt to enter upon the forbidden grounds,
must do so at the certain hazard of their lives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Of course such intelligence created great commotion
throughout the camp, and it formed
the sole subject of conversation and discussion
during the evenings around the camp fires.</p>

<p>Speaking of this report, and the effect produced
upon his men, Fremont uses the following
language:</p>

<p>"Carson, one of the best and most experienced
mountaineers, fully supported the opinion
given by Bridger of the dangerous state
of the country, and openly expressed his conviction
that we could not escape without some
sharp encounters with the Indians. In addition
to this, he made his will; and among the
circumstances which were constantly occurring
to increase their alarm, this was the most
unfortunate; and I found that a number of
my party had become so much intimidated
that they had requested to be discharged at
this place."</p>

<p>Carson's apprehensions were fully justified
by the circumstances surrounding them; and
while we might have omitted the above quotation,
as tending to exhibit him in a false light,
doubtless unintentionally, we choose rather to
say a few words which will rob the insinuation
of its sting.</p>

<p>While there was reason to expect an encounter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
with Indians, in whom it was reported
the spirit of revenge was cherished towards
the whites, more than ever it had been before,
and whom numbers and acquisition of fire-arms
rendered really formidable foes, he felt
that the party with whom he was now associated,
were not the men upon whom he could
rely with certainty in an engagement against
such terrible odds. In the days of his earlier
experiences, the old trappers with him were
men who had as little fear as himself, and
were also experienced in such little affairs, for
such they considered them. Now, except
Maxwell, an old associate, and two or three
others, the men of the party were half paralyzed
with fear at the prospect which this report
presented to them; and it was the knowledge
of their fear, which they made no attempt
to conceal, which excited in his mind apprehensions
for the worst, for he did not choose
to guide others into danger recklessly, even if
he had no care for himself.</p>

<p>Headlong rashness, which some might mistake
for courage, was not a trait of his character;
but the voice of a whole country accords
to him cool bravery, presence of mind, and
courage to meet whatever danger forethought
could not guard against.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
With a party of men like those he had led
several times against the Blackfeet, nothing
could have persuaded him to turn back from
any enterprise which he had undertaken, from
a fear of hostile Indians. Of course he could
not state his reason for his apprehensions even
to his employer, because it would reflect upon
his ability to arrange for such an enterprise,
or his courage to conduct it to a successful termination,
neither of which he could doubt; and
it is therefore with something of regret we
read in an official report, emanating from one
who owed more to Kit Carson, of the fame and
reputation so justly earned, than to any other
living man, the assertion that Carson, stimulated
by fear, made his will. The best contradiction
which can be afforded, is found in the
fact, that notwithstanding his <i>apprehensions</i>, he
did accompany the party, discharging with his
usual zeal, ability, and fidelity, the duties which
devolved upon him; and we have yet to learn
that Kit Carson ever shrunk from any danger.</p>

<p>His reputation has, however, outlived this
covert insinuation, and we presume that no
man on this continent would hesitate to award
to Kit Carson, the highest attributes of moral
and physical courage.</p>

<p>"During our stay here," says Fremont in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
continuation, "the men had been engaged in
making numerous repairs, arranging pack-saddles,
and otherwise preparing for the
chances of a rough road, and mountain travel,
all of which Carson had superintended, urging
upon the men that their comfort and their
safety required it. All things of this nature
being ready, I gathered them around me in the
evening, and told them that 'I had determined
to proceed the next day. They were all well
armed. I had engaged the services of Mr.
Bissonette as interpreter, and had taken, in
the circumstances, every possible means to insure
our safety. In the rumors we had heard, I
believed there was much exaggeration, and then
they were men accustomed to this kind of life,
and to the country; and that these were the
dangers of every day occurrence, and to be expected
in the ordinary course of their service.
They had heard of the unsettled condition of
the country before leaving St. Louis, and therefore
could not make it a reason for breaking
their engagements. Still, I was unwilling
to take with me, on a service of some certain
danger, men on whom I could not rely; and
as I had understood that there were among
them some who were disposed to cowardice,
and anxious to return, they had but to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
forward at once, and state their desire, and they
would be discharged with the amount due to
them for the time they had served.' To their
honor, be it said, there was but one among them
who had the face to come forward and avail
himself of the permission. I asked him some
few questions, in order to expose him to the ridicule
of the men, and let him go. The day after
our departure, he engaged himself to one of
the forts, and set off with a party to the Upper
Missouri."</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<p>As our explorers advanced, one of the most
prominent features of the country was the
abundance of artemisia growing everywhere,
on the hills and in the river bottoms, in twisted
wiry clumps, filling the air with the odor of
mingled camphor and spirits of turpentine,
and impeding the progress of the wagons out
of the beaten track.</p>

<p>They met a straggling party of the Indians
which had followed the trail of the emigrants,
and learned from them that multitudes of
grasshoppers had consumed the grass upon the
road, so that they had found no game, and
were obliged to kill even their horses, to ward
off starvation. Of course danger from these
Indians was no longer to be apprehended,
though the prospect was a gloomy one, but
new courage seemed to inspire the party when
the necessity of endurance seemed at hand.</p>

<p>The party now followed Carson's advice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
given at Fort Laramie, to disencumber themselves
of all unnecessary articles, and accordingly
they left their wagons, concealing them
among low shrubbery, after they had taken
them to pieces, and made a <i>cache</i> of such other
effects as they could leave, among the sand heaps
of the river bank, and then set to work to mend
and arrange the pack saddles, and packs, the
whole of which was superintended by Carson,
and to him was now assigned the office of
guide, as they had reached a section of the
country, with a great part of which long residence
had made him familiar. Game was
found in great abundance after they reached
the river bottom, off the traveled road, both
upon the Platte and after they crossed over
the <i>divide</i> to the Sweet Water.</p>

<p>Speaking of the gorge where the Platte
River issues from the Black Hills, changing its
character abruptly from a mountain stream to
a river of the plain, Fremont says, "I visited
this place with <i>my favorite man</i>, Basil Lajeunesse;"
and this extraordinary expression, left
unexplained, would lead the casual reader to
believe or think that Carson had lost the confidence
of the <i>official</i> leader of the party.</p>

<p>It has seemed to us, in reading Fremont's
narrative of this first expedition to the Rocky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Mountains, that in view of some failures to
achieve what was sought, and to avoid what
was suffered, Carson's advice, given with a
larger experience, and with less of impetuosity
than that of the young Huguenot's, would, if
followed, have secured different results, both
for the comfort of the party, and the benefit
of science; and while those of like temperament
were chosen for companions by Lieutenant
Fremont, it detracts nothing from his reputation
for scientific analysis and skill, or for
high courage, but only gives to Carson the deserved
meed of praise to say, his was the hand
that steadied the helm, and kept the vessel on
her way, at times when, without his judgment,
sagacity, and experience, it must have been seriously
damaged, if not destroyed; and with
this balance wheel, a part of his machinery,
the variety of difficulties that might have defeated
the scientific purpose of the expedition,
or have made it the last Fremont would desire,
or the Government care to have him undertake,
were avoided; and no one inquired to
know the cause.</p>

<p>It often happens that the quiet, simpler
offices of life become imperative, and first
duties, to one who feels that all the qualifications
fitting for more honorable place, are possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
by him, in much larger measure than
by the occupant of the higher official position,&mdash;as
men are wont to esteem it&mdash;and, as there
is no explanation given, nor, by declaration,
even the fact stated that this was true now in
respect to Christopher Carson, we shall give
no reason, further than to say, that the care of
finding suitable places for camping, of seeing
that the party were all in, and the animals
properly cared for, their saddles in order, and
the fastenings secure; of finding game, and
watching to see that the food is properly expended,
so that each supply shall last till it
can be replenished; of seeing that the general
property of the party is properly guarded, and
a variety of other matters, which pertain to
the success of an enterprise like this, and
without which it must be a failure, could not all
be borne by Fremont; and while he had
assigned to each his position in the labor of
the camp, the place of general care-taker,
which comes not by appointment, fell naturally
to the lot of Carson; and such supervision was
cheerfully performed, though it brought no
other reward than the satisfaction of knowing
that the essential elements of success were not
neglected.</p>

<p>Shall we not then deem him worthy of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
praise for being content to occupy such a position?
Employed to guide the party, he had
hoped to share the confidence of its leader, but
the latter had already other friends, jealous of
his attentions; he had another hunter, jealous
of his own reputation in his profession, and
of his knowledge of the country; then there
were two youths in the party, one of whom
wished to be amused, and both to be instructed;
and in becoming the general providence of the
party, which is scarcely thought of, because it
seems to come of itself, we find the reason why
Fremont's first narrative shows Carson so
little like the brave, bold hunter we have
known him hitherto. We allude to two lads,
one a son of the Hon. T. H. Benton, who accompanied
him out during a portion of his
first expedition, and for whom it is evident he
made many sacrifices.</p>

<p>Buffalo were numerous, and they saw many
tracks of the grizzly bear among the cherry
trees and currant bushes that lined the river
banks, while antelope bounded fitfully before
them over the plains.</p>

<p>But the reader is already familiar with this
condition of things in the country, because the
hero of our story has been here before, and to
apply the term explorer here to Fremont, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
to call this an exploring expedition, seems
farcical, only as we remember that there had
not been yet any written scientific description
of this region, so long familiar to the trappers,
and to none more than Carson.</p>

<p>They had now approached the road at what
is called the South Pass. The ascent had been
so gradual, that, with all the intimate knowledge
possessed by Carson, who had made this
country his home for seventeen years, they
were obliged to watch very closely to find the
place at which they reached the culminating
point. This was between two low hills, rising
on either hand fifty or sixty feet.</p>

<p>Approaching it from the mouth of the
Sweet Water, a sandy plain, one hundred and
twenty miles long, conducts, by a gradual and
regular ascent, to the summit, about seven
thousand feet above the sea; and the traveler,
without being reminded of any change by toilsome
ascents, suddenly finds himself on the
waters which flow to the Pacific ocean. By
the route they had traveled, the distance from
Fort Laramie was three hundred and twenty
miles, or nine hundred and fifty from the
mouth of the Kansas.</p>

<p>They continued on till they came to a tributary
of the Green River, and then followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the stream up to a lake at its source in the
mountains, and had here a view of extraordinary
magnificence and grandeur, beyond what
is seen in any part of the Alps, and here, beside
the placid lake, they left the mules, intending
to ascend the mountains on foot, and
measure the altitude of the highest point.</p>

<p>Fremont had wished to make a circuit of a
few miles in the mountains, and visit the
sources of the four great streams, the Colorado,
the Columbia, the Missouri, and the Platte,
but game was scarce, and his men were not accustomed
to their entirely meat fare, and were
discontented.</p>

<p>With fifteen picked men, mounted on the
best mules, was commenced the ascent of the
mountains, and amid views of most romantic
beauty, overlooking deep valleys with lakes
nestled in them, surrounded by precipitous
ridges, hundreds of feet high, they wound
their way up to the summits of the ridges, to
descend again, and plod along the valley of a
little stream on the other side.</p>

<p>For two days they continued upon their
mules, through this magnificent region, when
the peak appeared so near, it was decided to
leave the mules beside a little lake, and proceed
on foot; and as the day was warm, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of the party left their coats. But at night
they had reached the limit of the piney region,
when they were ten thousand feet above the
waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and still the
peak rose far above them, so that they camped
without suffering, in a little green ravine, bordered
with plants in bloom, and the next
morning continued the ascent. Carson had led
this day, and succeeded in reaching the summit
of a snowy peak, supposed to be the highest,
but saw from it the one they had been seeking,
towering eight hundred or a thousand feet
above him. They now descended off the
snow, and sent back for mules, and food, and
blankets, and by a blazing fire all slept soundly
until morning.</p>

<p>Carson had understood that they had now
done with the mountains, and by directions
had gone at day break to the camp, taking
with him all but four or five men, who were
to remain with Fremont, and take back the
mules and instruments. But after their departure,
the programme was changed, and now
understanding the topography of the country
better, the party left, continued with the mules
as far as possible, and then on foot, over
chasms, leaping from point to point of crags,
until they came, with extreme difficulty, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
intense cold and rarified air, to the height of
the crest, and Fremont stood alone upon the
pinnacle, and able to tell the story of this victory
of Science to the world. He had been
sick the day before, and Carson could not urge
the prosecution of the enterprise, to reach the
highest point, when the leader of the expedition
was too ill to climb the summit, and therefore
had not objected to the arrangement of
returning to the camp.</p>

<p>But we have nothing more to say. The
reader of the story, as Fremont tells it, wishes
there were evidences of higher magnanimity,
which are wanting. Carson finds no fault,
seems to notice none. He performed faithfully
the duty assigned to him, utters no complaint,
but is content in carrying out a subordinate's
first obligation, that of obeying orders.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>

<p>Fremont succeeded, but not without much
danger and suffering, in reaching the highest
peak of the Rocky Mountains, and waved over
it his country's flag, in triumph. The return
trip to Fort Laramie was not marked by any
incident of special note, and Carson's services
being no longer required, he left his commander
here, and set out for New Mexico. In
1843, he married a Spanish lady, and his time
was occasionally employed by Messrs. Bent
and St. Vrain, his old and tried friends.</p>

<p>While thus engaged at Bent's Fort, he
learned that his old commander and friend
had passed two days before, on another exploring
expedition, and being naturally anxious
to see again one to whom he was so
strongly attached, he started on his trail, and
after following it for seventy miles, came up
with him. The meeting was mutually pleasing,
but resulted quite contrary to Carson's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
anticipations, for, instead of merely meeting
and parting, Fremont, anxious to regain the services
of one whose experience, judgment, and
courage, had been so well tried, persuaded
him to join this second expedition, and again
we find him launched as guide and hunter.</p>

<p>Carson was at once despatched to the fort with
directions to procure a supply of mules which the
party much needed, and to meet him with the
animals at St. Vrain's Fort. This was accomplished
to Fremont's entire satisfaction. The
object of this second exploration was to connect
the survey of the previous year with those of
Commander Wilkes on the Pacific coast, but
Fremont's first destination was the Great Salt
Lake, which has since become so famous in the
annals of our country.</p>

<p>Fremont's description of this journey, and
of his passage across the lake in a frail India
rubber boat, which threatened at every moment
destruction to the entire party, is so true
to life, and so highly interesting, we quote it
entire. The party reached, on the 21st of August,
the Bear River, which was the principal
tributary of the lake, and from this point we
quote Fremont's words:</p>

<p>"We were now entering a region, which for
us, possessed a strange and extraordinary interest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
We were upon the waters of the famous
lake which forms a salient point among
the remarkable geographical features of the
country, and around which the vague and superstitious
accounts of the trappers had thrown
a delightful obscurity, which we anticipated
pleasure in dispelling, but which, in the meantime,
left a crowded field for the exercise of our
imagination.</p>

<p>"In our occasional conversations with the few
old hunters who had visited the region, it had
been a subject of frequent speculation; and the
wonders which they related were not the less
agreeable because they were highly exaggerated
and impossible.</p>

<p>"Hitherto this lake had been seen only by
trappers, who were wandering through the
country in search of new beaver streams, caring
very little for geography; its islands had
never been visited; and none were to be found
who had entirely made the circuit of its shores,
and no instrumental observations, or geographical
survey of any description, had ever been
made anywhere in the neighboring region. It
was generally supposed that it had no visible
outlet; but, among the trappers, including
those in my own camp, were many who believed
that somewhere on its surface was a terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
whirlpool, through which its waters found
their way to the ocean by some subterranean
communication. All these things had been made
a frequent subject of discussion in our desultory
conversations around the fires at night; and
my own mind had become tolerably well filled
with their indefinite pictures, and insensibly
colored with their romantic descriptions, which,
in the pleasure of excitement, I was well disposed
to believe, and half expected to realize.</p>

<p>"In about six miles' travel from our encampment,
we reached one of the points in our
journey to which we had always looked forward
with great interest&mdash;the famous Beer
Springs, which, on account of the effervescing
gas and acid taste, had received their name
from the voyageurs and trappers of the country,
who, in the midst of their rude and hard
lives, are fond of finding some fancied resemblance
to the luxuries they rarely have the
good fortune to enjoy.</p>

<p>"Although somewhat disappointed in the
expectations which various descriptions had led
me to form of unusual beauty of situation and
scenery, I found it altogether a place of very
great interest; and a traveler for the first time
in a volcanic region remains in a constant excitement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and at every step is arrested by
something remarkable and new. There is a
confusion of interesting objects gathered together
in a small space. Around the place of
encampment the Beer Springs were numerous;
but, as far as we could ascertain, were entirely
confined to that locality in the bottom. In the
bed of the river, in front, for a space of several
hundred yards, they were very abundant; the
effervescing gas rising up and agitating the
water in countless bubbling columns. In the
vicinity round about were numerous springs
of an entirely different and equally marked
mineral character. In a rather picturesque
spot, about 1,300 yards below our encampment
and immediately on the river bank, is the
most remarkable spring of the place. In an
opening on the rock, a white column of scattered
water is thrown up, in form like a <i>jet-d'eau</i>,
to a variable height of about three feet,
and, though it is maintained in a constant
supply, its greatest height is attained only at
regular intervals, according to the action of the
force below. It is accompanied by a subterranean
noise, which, together with the motion
of the water, makes very much the impression
of a steamboat in motion; and, without knowing
that it had been already previously so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
called, we gave to it the name of the Steamboat
Spring. The rock through which it is
forced is slightly raised in a convex manner,
and gathered at the opening into an urn-mouthed
form, and is evidently formed by
continued deposition from the water, and colored
bright red by oxide of iron.</p>

<p>"It is a hot spring, and the water has a pungent,
disagreeable metallic taste, leaving a
burning effect on the tongue. Within perhaps
two yards of the <i>jet-d'eau</i>, is a small hole of
about an inch in diameter, through which, at
regular intervals, escapes a blast of hot air
with a light wreath of smoke, accompanied by
a regular noise.</p>

<p>"As they approached the lake, they passed
over a country of bold and striking scenery,
and through several 'gates,' as they called certain
narrow valleys. The 'standing rock' is a
huge column, occupying the centre of one of
these passes. It fell from a height of perhaps
3,000 feet, and happened to remain in its
present upright position.</p>

<p>"At last, on the 6th of September, the object
for which their eyes had long been straining
was brought to view.</p>

<p>"<i>Sept. 6.</i>&mdash;This time we reached the butte
without any difficulty; and, ascending to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
summit, immediately at our feet beheld the
object of our anxious search, the waters of the
Inland Sea, stretching in still and solitary
grandeur far beyond the limit of our vision.
It was one of the great points of the exploration;
and as we looked eagerly over the lake
in the first emotions of excited pleasure, I am
doubtful if the followers of Balboa felt more
enthusiasm when, from the heights of the
Andes, they saw for the first time the great
Western Ocean. It was certainly a magnificent
object, and a noble <i>terminus</i> to this part
of our expedition; and to travelers so long
shut up among mountain ranges, a sudden
view over the expanse of silent waters had in
it something sublime. Several large islands
raised their high rocky heads out of the waves;
but whether or not they were timbered was
still left to our imagination, as the distance
was too great to determine if the dark hues
upon them were woodland or naked rock.
During the day the clouds had been gathering
black over the mountains to the westward, and
while we were looking, a storm burst down
with sudden fury upon the lake, and entirely
hid the islands from our view.</p>

<p>"On the edge of the stream a favorable spot
was selected in a grove, and felling the timber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
we made a strong <i>corral</i>, or horse-pen, for the
animals, and a little fort for the people who
were to remain. We were now probably in
the country of the Utah Indians, though none
reside upon the lake. The India-rubber boat
was repaired with prepared cloth and gum,
and filled with air, in readiness for the next
day.</p>

<p>"The provisions which Carson had brought
with him being now exhausted, and our stock
reduced to a small quantity of roots, I determined
to retain with me only a sufficient number
of men for the execution of our design;
and accordingly seven were sent back to Fort
Hall, under the guidance of François Lajeunesse,
who, having been for many years a
trapper in the country, was an experienced
mountaineer.</p>

<p>"We formed now but a small family. With
Mr. Preuss and myself, Carson, Bernier, and
Basil Lajeunesse had been selected for the
boat expedition&mdash;the first ever attempted on
this interior sea; and Badau, with Derosier,
and Jacob (the colored man), were to be left
in charge of the camp. We were favored with
most delightful weather. To-night there was
a brilliant sunset of golden orange and green,
which left the western sky clear and beautifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
pure; but clouds in the east made me lose
an occultation. The summer frogs were singing
around us, and the evening was very pleasant,
with a temperature of 60°&mdash;a night of a more
southern autumn. For our supper, we had
<i>yampah</i>, the most agreeably flavored of the roots,
seasoned by a small fat duck, which had come
in the way of Jacob's rifle. Around our fire
to-night were many speculations on what to-morrow
would bring forth; and in our busy
conjectures we fancied that we should find
every one of the large islands a tangled wilderness
of trees and shrubbery, teeming with
game of every description that the neighboring
region afforded, and which the foot of a
white man or Indian had never violated. Frequently,
during the day, clouds had rested on
the summits of their lofty mountains, and we
believed that we should find clear streams and
springs of fresh water; and we indulged in
anticipations of the luxurious repasts with
which we were to indemnify ourselves for past
privations. Neither, in our discussions, were
the whirlpool and other mysterious dangers forgotten,
which Indian and hunters' stories attributed
to this unexplored lake. The men had discovered
that, instead of being strongly sewed,
(like that of the preceding year, which had so triumphantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
rode the cañons of the Upper Great
Platte,) our present boat was only pasted together
in a very insecure manner, the maker
having been allowed so little time in the construction
that he was obliged to crowd the
labor of two months into several days. The
insecurity of the boat was sensibly felt by us;
and mingled with the enthusiasm and excitement
that we all felt at the prospect of an
undertaking which had never before been accomplished,
was a certain impression of danger,
sufficient to give a serious character to our
conversation. The momentary view which
had been had of the lake the day before, its
great extent, and rugged islands, dimly seen
amidst the dark waters in the obscurity of the
sudden storm, were well calculated to heighten
the idea of undefined danger with which the
lake was generally associated.</p>

<p>"<i>Sept. 8.</i>&mdash;A calm, clear day, with a sunrise
temperature of 41°. In view of our present
enterprise, a part of the equipment of the boat
had been made to consist of three air-tight
bags, about three feet long, and capable each
of containing five gallons. These had been
filled with water the night before, and were
now placed in the boat, with our blankets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
instruments, consisting of a sextant, telescope,
spy-glass, thermometer, and barometer.</p>

<p>"In the course of the morning we discovered
that two of the cylinders leaked so much as to
require one man constantly at the bellows, to
keep them sufficiently full of air to support
the boat. Although we had made a very
early start, we loitered so much on the way&mdash;stopping
every now and then, and floating silently
along, to get a shot at a goose or a duck&mdash;that
it was late in the day when we reached
the outlet. The river here divided into several
branches, filled with fluvials, and so very
shallow that it was with difficulty we could get
the boat along, being obliged to get out and
wade. We encamped on a low point among
rushes and young willows, where there was a
quantity of driftwood, which served for our fires.
The evening was mild and clear; we made a
pleasant bed of the young willows; and geese
and ducks enough had been killed for an abundant
supper at night, and for breakfast next
morning. The stillness of the night was enlivened
by millions of water-fowl.</p>

<p>"<i>Sept. 9.</i>&mdash;The day was clear and calm; the
thermometer at sunrise at 49°. As is usual
with the trappers on the eve of any enterprise,
our people had made dreams, and theirs happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to be a bad one&mdash;one which always preceded
evil&mdash;and consequently they looked very
gloomy this morning; but we hurried through
our breakfast, in order to make an early start,
and have all the day before us for our adventure.
The channel in a short distance became
so shallow that our navigation was at an end,
being merely a sheet of soft mud, with a few
inches of water, and sometimes none at all,
forming the low-water shore of the lake. All
this place was absolutely covered with flocks of
screaming plover. We took off our clothes, and,
getting overboard, commenced dragging the
boat&mdash;making, by this operation, a very curious
trail, and a very disagreeable smell in
stirring up the mud, as we sank above the
knee at every step. The water here was still
fresh, with only an insipid and disagreeable
taste, probably derived from the bed of fetid
mud. After proceeding in this way about a<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">mile, we came to a small black ridge on the</span><br />
bottom, beyond which the water became suddenly
salt, beginning gradually to deepen, and
the bottom was sandy and firm. It was a remarkable
division, separating the fresh water
of the rivers from the briny water of the lake,
which was entirely <i>saturated</i> with common salt.
Pushing our little vessel across the narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
boundary, we sprang on board, and at length
were afloat on the waters of the unknown
sea.</p>

<p>"We did not steer for the mountainous
islands, but directed our course towards a
lower one, which it had been decided we should
first visit, the summit of which was formed
like the crater at the upper end of Bear River
valley. So long as we could touch the bottom
with our paddles, we were very gay; but gradually,
as the water deepened, we became more
still in our frail batteau of gum cloth distended
with air, and with pasted seams. Although
the day was very calm, there was a considerable
swell on the lake; and there were white
patches of foam on the surface, which were
slowly moving to the southward, indicating the
set of a current in that direction, and recalling
the recollection of the whirlpool stories. The
water continued to deepen as we advanced;
the lake becoming almost transparently clear,
of an extremely beautiful bright green color;
and the spray, which was thrown into the boat
and over our clothes, was directly converted
into a crust of common salt, which covered
also our hands and arms. 'Captain,' said Carson,
who for some time had been looking suspiciously
at some whitening appearances outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the nearest islands, 'what are those yonder?&mdash;won't
you just take a look with the
glass?' We ceased paddling for a moment,
and found them to be the caps of the waves
that were beginning to break under the force
of a strong breeze that was coming up the
lake. The form of the boat seemed to be an
admirable one, and it rode on the waves like a
water bird; but, at the same time, it was extremely
slow in its progress. When we were
a little more than half away across the reach,
two of the divisions between the cylinders
gave way, and it required the constant use of
the bellows to keep in a sufficient quantity of
air. For a long time we scarcely seemed to
approach our island, but gradually we worked
across the rougher sea of the open channel,
into the smoother water under the lee of the
island, and began to discover that what we
took for a long row of pelicans, ranged on the
beach, were only low cliffs whitened with salt
by the spray of the waves; and about noon
we reached the shore, the transparency of the
water enabling us to see the bottom at a considerable
depth.</p>

<p>"The cliffs and masses of rock along the
shore were whitened by an incrustation of salt
where the waves dashed up against them; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the evaporating water, which had been left in
holes and hollows on the surface of the rocks,
was covered with a crust of salt about one-eighth
of an inch in thickness.</p>

<p>"Carrying with us the barometer and other
instruments, in the afternoon we ascended to
the highest point of the island&mdash;a bare, rocky
peak, 800 feet above the lake. Standing on
the summit, we enjoyed an extended view of
the lake, inclosed in a basin of rugged mountains,
which sometimes left marshy flats and
extensive bottoms between them and the shore,
and in other places came directly down into
the water with bold and precipitous bluffs.</p>

<p>"As we looked over the vast expanse of
water spread out beneath us, and strained our
eyes along the silent shores over which hung
so much doubt and uncertainty, and which
were so full of interest to us, I could hardly
repress the almost irresistible desire to continue
our exploration; but the lengthening
snow on the mountains was a plain indication
of the advancing season, and our frail linen
boat appeared so insecure that I was unwilling
to trust our lives to the uncertainties of the
lake. I therefore unwillingly resolved to terminate
our survey here, and remain satisfied for
the present with what we had been able to add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
to the unknown geography of the region. We
felt pleasure also in remembering that we were
the first who, in the traditionary annals of the
country, had visited the islands, and broken,
with the cheerful sound of human voices, the
long solitude of the place.</p>

<p>"I accidentally left on the summit the brass
cover to the object end of my spy-glass; and
as it will probably remain there undisturbed
by Indians, it will furnish matter of speculation
to some future traveler. In our excursions
about the island, we did not meet with
any kind of animal; a magpie, and another
larger bird, probably attracted by the smoke
of our fire, paid us a visit from the shore, and
were the only living things seen during our
stay. The rock constituting the cliffs along
the shore where we were encamped, is a talcous
rock, or steatite, with brown spar.</p>

<p>"At sunset, the temperature was 70°. We
had arrived just in time to obtain a meridian
altitude of the sun, and other observations
were obtained this evening, which place our
camp in latitude 41° 102&#8242; 42&#8243;, and longitude
112° 21&#8242; 05&#8243; from Greenwich. From a discussion
of the barometrical observations made
during our stay on the shores of the lake, we
have adopted 4,200 feet for its elevation above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the Gulf of Mexico. In the first disappointment
we felt from the dissipation of our dream
of the fertile islands, I called this Disappointment
Island.</p>

<p>"Out of the driftwood, we made ourselves
pleasant little lodges, open to the water, and,
after having kindled large fires to excite the
wonder of any straggling savage on the lake
shores, lay down, for the first time in a long
journey, in perfect security; no one thinking
about his arms. The evening was extremely
bright and pleasant; but the wind rose during
the night, and the waves began to break heavily
on the shore, making our Island tremble.
I had not expected in our inland journey to
hear the roar of an ocean surf; and the
strangeness of our situation, and the excitement
we felt in the associated interests of the
place, made this one of the most interesting
nights I remember during our long expedition.</p>

<p>"In the morning, the surf was breaking
heavily on the shore, and we were up early.
The lake was dark and agitated, and we hurried
through our scanty breakfast, and embarked&mdash;having
first filled one of the buckets
with water from which it was intended to make
salt. The sun had risen by the time we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
ready to start; and it was blowing a strong
gale of wind, almost directly off the shore, and
raising a considerable sea, in which our boat
strained very much. It roughened as we got
away from the island, and it required all the
efforts of the men to make any head against
the wind and sea; the gale rising with the
sun; and there was danger of being blown into
one of the open reaches beyond the island.
At the distance of half a mile from the beach,
the depth of water was sixteen feet, with a clay
bottom; but, as the working of the boat was
very severe labor, and during the operation of
sounding, it was necessary to cease paddling,
during which, the boat lost considerable way,
I was unwilling to discourage the men, and
reluctantly gave up my intention of ascertaining
the depth and character of the bed. There
was a general shout in the boat when we found
ourselves in one fathom, and we soon after
landed on a low point of mud, where we unloaded
the boat, and carried the baggage to
firmer ground."</p>

<p>Roughly evaporated over the fire, the five
gallons of water from this lake yielded fourteen
pints of very fine-grained and very white
salt, of which the whole lake may be regarded
as a saturated solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
On the 12th they resumed their journey, returning
by the same route, and at night had a
supper of sea gulls, which Carson killed near
the lake.</p>

<p>The next day they continued up the river,
hunger making them very quiet and peaceable;
and there was rarely an oath to be heard in
the camp&mdash;not even a solitary <i>enfant de garce</i>.
It was time for the men with an expected supply
of provisions from Fitzpatrick to be in
the neighborhood; and the gun was fired at
evening, to give notice of their locality, but
met with no response.</p>

<p>They killed to-day a fat young horse,
purchased from the Indians, and were very
soon restored to gaiety and good humor.
Fremont and Mr. Preuss, not having yet
overcome the prejudices of civilization, did
not partake, preferring to turn in supperless.</p>

<p>The large number of emigrants constantly
encamping here, had driven the game into the
mountains, so that not an elk or antelope was
seen upon the route; but an antelope was purchased
from an Indian, for a little powder and
some ball, and they camped early to enjoy an
abundant supper; which, while not yet prepared,
was interrupted by the arrival of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
trapper, who startled and rejoiced all by announcing
the glad news, that Mr. Fitzpatrick
was in camp a little way from them, with a
plentiful supply of provisions, flour, rice, dried
meat, and even butter.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>

<p>The difficulty, in view of the approaching
winter season, of supporting a large party, determined
Fremont to send back a number of
the men who had become satisfied that they
were not fitted for the laborious service and
frequent privation to which they were necessarily
exposed, and which there was reason to
believe would become more severe in the
further extension of the voyage. They were
accordingly called together, and after being
fully informed as to the nature of the duties
imposed upon them, and the hardships they
would have to undergo, eleven of the party
consented to abandon Fremont, and return;
but Carson was not one of these.</p>

<p>Taking leave of the homeward party, they
resumed their journey down the valley, the
weather being very cold, and the rain coming
in hard gusts, which the wind blew directly in
their faces. They forded the Portneuf in a storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of rain, the water in the river being frequently
up to the axles.</p>

<p>Fremont in his official report thus enumerates
some of the difficulties and sufferings
the party had to encounter:</p>

<p>"<i>September 27.</i>&mdash;It was now no longer possible,
as in our previous journey, to travel regularly
every day, and find at any moment a
convenient place for repose at noon, or a camp
at night; but the halting places were now
generally fixed along the road, by the nature
of the country, at places where, with water,
there was a little scanty grass. Since leaving
the American falls, the road had frequently
been very bad; the many short, steep ascents
exhausting the strength of our worn out animals,
requiring always at such places the assistance
of the men to get up each cart, one by
one; and our progress with twelve or fourteen
wheeled carriages, though light and made for
the purpose, in such a rocky country, was extremely
slow.</p>

<p>"Carson had met here three or four buffalo
bulls, two of which were killed. They were
among the pioneers which had made the experiment
of colonizing in the valley of the Columbia.</p>

<p>"Opposite to the encampment, a subterranean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
river bursts out directly from the face of
the escarpment, and falls in white foam to the
river below. The main river is enclosed with
mural precipices, which form its characteristic
feature, along a great portion of its course. A
melancholy and strange-looking country&mdash;one
of fracture, and violence, and fire.</p>

<p>"We had brought with us, when we separated
from the camp, a large gaunt ox, in appearance
very poor; but, being killed to-night,
to the great joy of the people, he was found to
be remarkably fat. As usual at such occurrences,
the evening was devoted to gaiety and
feasting; abundant fare now made an epoch
among us; and in this laborious life, in such a
country as this, our men had but little else to
enjoy."</p>

<p>On arriving at the ford where the road
crosses to the right bank of Snake River, an
Indian was hired to conduct them through the
ford, which proved impracticable; the water
sweeping away the howitzer and nearly drowning
the mules. Fortunately they had a resource
in a boat, which was filled with air and
launched; and at seven o'clock were safely encamped
on the opposite bank, the animals
swimming across, and the carriage, howitzer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and baggage of the camp being carried over in
the boat.</p>

<p>It was while at Fort Boise where Fremont
first met Mons. Payette, an employee of the
Hudson Bay Co., that he came across the
"Fish-eating Indians," a class lower if possible
in the scale of humanity than the "Diggers."
He says:</p>

<p>"Many little accounts and scattered histories,
together with an acquaintance which I
gradually acquired of their modes of life, had
left the aboriginal inhabitants of this vast
region pictured in my mind as a race of people
whose great and constant occupation was the
means of procuring a subsistence.</p>

<p>"While the summer weather and the salmon
lasted, they lived contentedly and happily,
scattered along the different streams where
the fish were to be found; and as soon as the
winter snows began to fall, little smokes would
be seen rising among the mountains, where
they would be found in miserable groups,
starving out the winter; and sometimes, according
to the general belief, reduced to the
horror of cannibalism&mdash;the strong, of course,
preying on the weak. Certain it is, they are
driven to an extremity for food, and eat every
insect, and every creeping thing, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
loathsome and repulsive. Snails, lizards, ants&mdash;all
are devoured with the readiness and
greediness of mere animals."</p>

<p>The remainder of the overland journey,
until they reached Nez Percé, one of the trading
establishments of the Hudson Bay Company,
was not marked by any incident bringing
Carson into special notice.</p>

<p>Having now completed the connection of
his explorations with those of Commander
Wilkes, and which was the limit of his instructions,
Fremont commenced preparations
for his return, Carson being left at the <i>Dalles</i>
with directions to occupy the people in making
pack-saddles, and refitting the equippage;
while Fremont continued his journey to the
Mission, a few miles down the Columbia River,
where he passed a few days in comparative
luxury.</p>

<p>The few days of rest, added to an abundance
of wholesome food, had so far recruited the
party, that they were soon prepared to encounter
and conquer the difficulties of this overland
journey in mid-winter. Three principal objects
were indicated by Fremont for exploration
and research, and which, despite the obstacles
which the season must so surely interpose,
he had determined to visit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
The first of these points was the <i>Tlamath</i>
Lake, on the table-land between the head of
Fall River, which comes to the Columbia, and
the Sacramento, which goes to the bay of San
Francisco; and from which lake a river of the
same name makes its way westwardly direct to
the ocean.</p>

<p>From this lake their course was intended to
be about southeast, to a reported lake called
Mary's, at some days' journey in the Great
Basin; and thence, still on southeast, to the
reputed <i>Buenaventura</i> River, which has had a
place in so many maps, and countenanced the
belief of the existence of a great river flowing
from the Rocky Mountains to the Bay of San
Francisco. From the Buenaventura, the next
point was intended to be in that section of the
Rocky Mountains which includes the heads of
Arkansas River, and of the opposite waters of
the Californian Gulf; and thence down the
Arkansas to Bent's Fort, and home. This
was the projected line of return&mdash;a great part of
it absolutely new to geographical, botanical, and
geological science&mdash;and the subject of reports
in relation to lakes, rivers, deserts, and savages,
hardly above the condition of mere wild
animals, which inflamed desire to know what
this <i>terra incognita</i> really contained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
It was a serious enterprise at the commencement
of winter to undertake the traverse of
such a region, and with a party consisting
only of twenty-five persons, and they of many
nations&mdash;American, French, German, Canadian,
Indian, and colored&mdash;and most of them
young, several being under twenty-one years
of age. All knew that a strange country was
to be explored, and dangers and hardships to
be encountered; but no one blenched at the
prospect. On the contrary, courage and confidence
animated the whole party. Cheerfulness,
readiness, subordination, prompt obedience,
characterized all; nor did any extremity
of peril and privation, to which they were afterwards
exposed, ever belie, or derogate from,
the fine spirit of this brave and generous commencement.</p>

<p>For the support of the party, he had provided
at Vancouver a supply of provisions for
not less than three months, consisting principally
of flour, peas, and tallow&mdash;the latter
being used in cooking; and, in addition to
this, they had purchased at the mission, some
California cattle, which were to be driven on
the hoof. They had one hundred and four
mules and horses&mdash;part of the latter procured
from the Indians about the mission; and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the sustenance of which, their reliance was
upon the grass which might be found, and the
soft porous wood, which was to be substituted
when there was no grass.</p>

<p>Mr. Fitzpatrick, with Mr. Talbot and the
remainder of the party, arrived on the 21st;
and the camp was now closely engaged in the
labor of preparation. Mr. Perkins succeeded
in obtaining as a guide, to the Tlamath Lake,
two Indians&mdash;one of whom had been there,
and bore the marks of several wounds he had
received from some of the Indians in the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>Tlamath Lake, however, on examination,
proved to be simply a shallow basin, which,
for a short period at the time of melting snows,
is covered with water from the neighboring
mountains; but this probably soon runs off,
and leaves for the remainder of the year a
green savannah, through the midst of which,
the river Tlamath, which flows to the ocean,
winds its way to the outlet on the southwestern
side.</p>

<p>After leaving Tlamath Lake the party
headed for Mary's Lake, which, however,
after incredible sufferings and hardships, they
failed to discover, but they found one which
was appropriately christened "Pyramid Lake,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and here the record of toils, dangers and sufferings,
undergone by the whole party, can
only be told in the language of him, who
cheerfully toiled and suffered with those under
his command, and it is not too much to say,
that with the exception of the "Strain expedition,"
across the Isthmus of Darien, no
party of men have ever lived to narrate such
sad experiences. We therefore let Fremont,
in his own modest way, tell the tale of his own
and his companions' sufferings.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

<p>"<i>January 3.</i>&mdash;A fog, so dense that we could
not see a hundred yards, covered the country,
and the men that were sent out after the horses
were bewildered and lost; and we were consequently
detained at camp until late in the day.
Our situation had now become a serious one.
We had reached and run over the position
where, according to the best maps in my possession,
we should have found Mary's Lake or
river. We were evidently on the verge of the
desert which had been reported to us; and the
appearance of the country was so forbidding,
that I was afraid to enter it, and determined to
bear away to the southward, keeping close
along the mountains, in the full expectation of
reaching the Buenaventura River. This morning
I put every man in the camp on foot&mdash;myself,
of course, among the rest&mdash;and in this
manner lightened by distribution the loads of
the animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
"<i>January 4.</i>&mdash;The fog to-day was still more
dense, and the people again were bewildered.
We traveled a few miles around the western
point of the ridge, and encamped where there
were a few tufts of grass, but no water. Our
animals now were in a very alarming state,
and there was increasing anxiety in the camp.</p>

<p>"<i>January 5.</i>&mdash;Same dense fog continued,
and one of the mules died in camp this morning.
We moved to a place where there was a
little better grass, about two miles distant.
Taplin, one of our best men, who had gone out
on a scouting excursion, ascended a mountain
near by, and to his great surprise emerged into
a region of bright sunshine, in which the upper
parts of the mountain were glowing, while
below all was obscured in the darkest fog.</p>

<p>"<i>January 6.</i>&mdash;The fog continued the same,
and with Mr. Preuss and Carson, I ascended
the mountain, to sketch the leading features of
the country, as some indication of our future
route, while Mr. Fitzpatrick explored the
country below. In a very short distance we
had ascended above the mist, but the view obtained
was not very gratifying. The fog had
partially cleared off from below when we
reached the summit; and in the south-west
corner of a basin communicating with that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
which we had encamped, we saw a lofty column
of smoke, 16 miles distant, indicating the
presence of hot springs. There, also, appeared
to be the outlet of those draining channels of
the country; and, as such places afforded always
more or less grass, I determined to steer
in that direction. The ridge we had ascended
appeared to be composed of fragments of white
granite. We saw here traces of sheep and
antelope.</p>

<p>"Entering the neighboring valley, and
crossing the bed of another lake, after a hard
day's travel over ground of yielding mud and
sand, we reached the springs, where we found
an abundance of grass, which, though only
tolerably good, made this place, with reference
to the past, a refreshing and agreeable spot.</p>

<p>"This is the most extraordinary locality of
hot springs we had met during the journey.
The basin of the largest one has a circumference
of several hundred feet; but there is at
one extremity a circular space of about fifteen
feet in diameter, entirely occupied by the boiling
water. It boils up at irregular intervals,
and with much noise. The water is clear, and
the spring deep; a pole about sixteen feet long
was easily immersed in the centre, but we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
had no means of forming a good idea of the
depth.</p>

<p>"Taking with me Godey and Carson, I
made to-day a thorough exploration of the
neighboring valleys, and found in a ravine in
the bordering mountains a good camping
place, where was water in springs, and a sufficient
quantity of grass for a night. Overshadowing
the springs were some trees of the
sweet cotton-wood, which, after a long interval
of absence, we saw again with pleasure, regarding
them as harbingers of a better country.
To us, they were eloquent of green prairies
and buffalo. We found here a broad and
plainly marked trail, on which there were tracks
of horses, and we appeared to have regained
one of the thoroughfares which pass by the
watering places of the country. On the western
mountains of the valley, with which this
of the boiling spring communicates, we remarked
scattered cedars&mdash;probably an indication
that we were on the borders of the timbered
region extending to the Pacific. We
reached the camp at sunset, after a day's ride
of about forty miles.</p>

<p>"<i>January 10.</i>&mdash;We continued our reconnoissance
ahead, pursuing a south direction in the
basin along the ridge; the camp following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
slowly after. On a large trail there is never
any doubt of finding suitable places for encampments.
We reached the end of the basin,
where we found, in a hollow of the mountain
which enclosed it, an abundance of good bunch
grass. Leaving a signal for the party to encamp,
we continued our way up the hollow,
intending to see what lay beyond the mountain.
The hollow was several miles long,
forming a good pass, the snow deepening to
about a foot as we neared the summit. Beyond,
a defile between the mountains descended
rapidly about two thousand feet; and, filling
up all the lower space, was a sheet of green
water, some twenty miles broad. It broke
upon our eyes like the ocean. The neighboring
peaks rose high above us, and we ascended
one of them to obtain a better view. The
waves were curling in the breeze, and their
dark-green color showed it to be a body of
deep water. For a long time we sat enjoying
the view, for we had become fatigued with
mountains, and the free expanse of moving
waves was very grateful. It was set like a
gem in the mountains, which, from our position,
seemed to enclose it almost entirely. At
the western end it communicated with the
line of basins we had left a few days since;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and on the opposite side it swept a ridge of
snowy mountains, the foot of the great Sierra.
Its position at first inclined us to believe
it Mary's Lake, but the rugged mountains
were so entirely discordant with descriptions
of its low rushy shores and open country, that
we concluded it some unknown body of water;
which it afterwards proved to be.</p>

<p>"We saw before us, in descending from the
pass, a great continuous range, along which
stretched the valley of the river; the lower
parts steep, and dark with pines, while above
it was hidden in clouds of snow. This, we felt
instantly satisfied was the central ridge of the
Sierra Nevada, the great California mountain,
which only now intervened between us and
the waters of the bay. We had made a forced
march of 26 miles, and three mules had given
out on the road. Up to this point, with the
exception of two stolen by Indians, we had
lost none of the horses which had been brought
from the Columbia river, and a number of
these were still strong and in tolerably good
order. We had now sixty-seven animals in
the band.</p>

<p>"We had scarcely lighted our fires, when the
camp was crowded with nearly naked Indians.
There were two who appeared particularly intelligent&mdash;one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
a somewhat old man. He told
me that, before the snows fell, it was six sleeps
to the place where the whites lived, but that
now it was impossible to cross the mountain on
account of the deep snow; and showing us, as
the others had done, that it was over our
heads, he urged us strongly to follow the
course of the river, which he said would conduct
us to a lake in which there were many
large fish. There, he said, were many people;
there was no snow on the ground; and we
might remain there until spring. From their
descriptions, we were enabled to judge that we
had encamped on the upper water of the Salmon-trout
River. It is hardly necessary to
say that our communication was only by signs,
as we understood nothing of their language;
but they spoke, notwithstanding, rapidly and
vehemently, explaining what they considered
the folly of our intentions, and urging us to go
down to the lake. <i>Tah-ve</i>, a word signifying
snow, we very soon learned to know, from its
frequent repetition. I told him that the men
and the horses were strong, and that we would
break a road through the snow; and spreading
before him our bales of scarlet cloth, and trinkets,
showed him what we would give for a
guide. It was necessary to obtain one, if possible;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
for I had determined here to attempt
the passage of the mountain. Pulling a bunch
of grass from the ground, after a short discussion
among themselves, the old man made us
comprehend, that if we could break through
the snow, at the end of three days we would
come down upon grass, which he showed
us would be about six inches high, and where
the ground was entirely free. So far he said
he had been in hunting for elk; but beyond
that (and he closed his eyes) he had seen nothing;
but there was one among them who had
been to the whites, and, going out of the lodge,
he returned with a young man of very intelligent
appearance. Here, said he, is a young
man who has seen the whites with his own
eyes; and he swore, first by the sky, and then
by the ground, that what he said was true.
With a large present of goods, we prevailed
upon this young man to be our guide, and he
acquired among us the name Mélo&mdash;a word
signifying friend, which they used very frequently.
He was thinly clad, and nearly barefoot;
his moccasins being about worn out. We
gave him skins to make a new pair, and to enable
him to perform his undertaking to us.
The Indians remained in camp during the
night, and we kept the guide and two others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
to sleep in the lodge with us&mdash;Carson lying
across the door, and having made them comprehend
the use of our fire-arms."</p>

<p>Fremont here, after a consultation with some
Indians who came into his camp, made up his
mind to attempt the passage of the mountains
at every hazard. He therefore, to quote his
own words, called his men together, and "reminded
them of the beautiful valley of the
Sacramento, with which they were familiar
from the descriptions of Carson, who had been
there some fifteen years ago, and who, in our
late privations, had delighted us in speaking
of its rich pastures and abounding game, and
drew a vivid contrast between its summer
climate, less than a hundred miles distant, and
the falling snow around us. I informed them
(and long experience had given them confidence
in my observations and good instruments)
that almost directly west, and only
about seventy miles distant, was the great
farming establishment of Captain Sutter&mdash;a
gentleman who had formerly lived in Missouri,
and, emigrating to this country, had become
the possessor of a principality. I assured them
that, from the heights of the mountain before
us, we should doubtless see the valley of the
Sacramento River, and with one effort place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
ourselves again in the midst of plenty. The
people received this decision with the cheerful
obedience which had always characterized
them; and the day was immediately devoted
to the preparations necessary to enable us to
carry it into effect. Leggins, moccasins, clothing&mdash;all
were put into the best state to resist
the cold. Our guide was not neglected. Extremity
of suffering might make him desert;
we therefore did the best we could for him.
Leggins, moccasins, some articles of clothing,
and a large green blanket, in addition to the
blue and scarlet cloth, were lavished upon him,
and to his great and evident contentment. He
arrayed himself in all his colors; and, clad in
green, blue, and scarlet, he made a gay-looking
Indian; and, with his various presents, was
probably richer and better clothed than any of
his tribe had ever been before.</p>

<p>"I have already said that our provisions
were very low; we had neither tallow nor
grease of any kind remaining, and the want
of salt became one of our greatest privations.
The poor dog which had been found in the
Bear River valley, and which had been a
<i>compagnon de voyage</i> ever since, had now become
fat, and the mess to which it belonged
requested permission to kill it. Leave was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
granted. Spread out on the snow, the meat
looked very good; and it made a strengthening
meal for the greater part of the camp.</p>

<p>"The people were unusually silent; for
every man knew that our enterprise was hazardous,
and the issue doubtful.</p>

<p>"The snow deepened rapidly, and it soon became
necessary to break a road. For this service,
a party of ten was formed, mounted on
the strongest horses; each man in succession
opening the road on foot, or on horseback,
until himself and his horse became fatigued,
when he stepped aside; and, the remaining
number passing ahead, he took his station in
the rear.</p>

<p>"The camp had been all the day occupied in
endeavoring to ascend the hill, but only the
best horses had succeeded; the animals, generally,
not having sufficient strength to bring
themselves up without the packs; and all the
line of road between this and the springs was
strewed with camp stores and equipage, and
horses floundering in snow. I therefore immediately
encamped on the ground with my own
mess, which was in advance, and directed Mr.
Fitzpatrick to encamp at the springs, and send
all the animals, in charge of Tabeau, with a
strong guard, back to the place where they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
been pastured the night before. Here was
a small spot of level ground, protected on
one side by the mountain, and on the other
sheltered by a little ridge of rock. It was an
open grove of pines, which assimilated in size
to the grandeur of the mountain, being frequently
six feet in diameter.</p>

<p>"To-night we had no shelter, but we made a
large fire around the trunk of one of the huge
pines; and covering the snow with small
boughs, on which we spread our blankets, soon
made ourselves comfortable. The night was
very bright and clear, though the thermometer
was only at 10°. A strong wind which sprang
up at sundown, made it intensely cold; and
this was one of the bitterest nights during the
journey.</p>

<p>"Two Indians joined our party here; and
one of them, an old man, immediately began
to harangue us, saying that ourselves and animals
would perish in the snow; and that, if we
would go back, he would show us another and
a better way across the mountain. He spoke
in a very loud voice, and there was a singular
repetition of phrases and arrangement of
words, which rendered his speech striking, and
not unmusical.</p>

<p>"We had now begun to understand some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
words, and, with the aid of signs, easily comprehended
the old man's simple ideas. 'Rock
upon rock&mdash;rock upon rock&mdash;snow upon snow&mdash;snow
upon snow,' said he; 'even if you get
over the snow, you will not be able to get
down from the mountains.' He made us the
sign of precipices, and showed us how the feet
of the horses would slip, and throw them off
from the narrow trails which led along their
sides. Our Chinook, who comprehended even
more readily than ourselves, and believed our
situation hopeless, covered his head with his
blanket, and began to weep and lament. 'I
wanted to see the whites,' said he; 'I came
away from my own people to see the whites,
and I wouldn't care to die among them; but
here'&mdash;and he looked around into the cold
night and gloomy forest, and, drawing his
blanket over his head, began again to lament.</p>

<p>"Seated around the tree, the fire illuminating
the rocks and the tall bolls of the pines
round about, and the old Indian haranguing,
we presented a group of very serious faces.</p>

<p>"<i>February 5.</i>&mdash;The night had been too cold
to sleep, and we were up very early. Our
guide was standing by the fire with all his
finery on; and seeing him shiver in the cold, I
threw on his shoulders one of my blankets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
We missed him a few minutes afterwards, and
never saw him again. He had deserted. His
bad faith and treachery were in perfect keeping
with the estimate of Indian character, which a
long intercourse with this people had gradually
forced upon my mind.</p>

<p>"While a portion of the camp were occupied
in bringing up the baggage to this point, the
remainder were busied in making sledges and
snow shoes. I had determined to explore the
mountain ahead, and the sledges were to be
used in transporting the baggage.</p>

<p>"Crossing the open basin, in a march of
about ten miles we reached the top of one
of the peaks, to the left of the pass indicated
by our guide. Far below us, dimmed
by the distance, was a large, snowless valley,
bounded on the western side, at the distance
of about a hundred miles, by a low range of
mountains, which Carson recognized with delight
as the mountains bordering the coast.
'There,' said he, 'is the little mountain&mdash;it is
fifteen years ago since I saw it; but I am just as
sure as if I had seen it yesterday.' Between
us, then, and this low coast range, was the
valley of the Sacramento; and no one who had
not accompanied us through the incidents of
our life for the last few months, could realize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the delight with which at last we looked down
upon it. At the distance of apparently thirty
miles beyond us were distinguished spots of
prairie; and a dark line, which could be traced
with the glass, was imagined to be the course
of the river; but we were evidently at a great
height above the valley, and between us and
the plains extended miles of snowy fields and
broken ridges of pine-covered mountains.</p>

<p>"It was late in the day when we turned
towards the camp; and it grew rapidly cold
as it drew towards night. One of the men became
fatigued, and his feet began to freeze,
and building a fire in the trunk of a dry old
cedar, Mr. Fitzpatrick remained with him
until his clothes could be dried, and he was in
a condition to come on. After a day's march
of twenty miles, we straggled into camp, one
after another, at nightfall; the greater number
excessively fatigued, only two of the party
having ever traveled on snow-shoes before.</p>

<p>"All our energies were now directed to getting
our animals across the snow; and it was supposed
that, after all the baggage had been drawn
with the sleighs over the trail we had made, it
would be sufficiently hard to bear our animals.</p>

<p>"At several places, between this point and the
ridge, we had discovered some grassy spots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
where the wind and sun had dispersed the snow
from the sides of the hills, and these were to
form resting places to support the animals for
a night in their passage across. On our way
across, we had set on fire several broken stumps
and dried trees, to melt holes in the snow for
the camp. Its general depth was five feet; but
we passed over places where it was twenty feet
deep, as shown by the trees.</p>

<p>"With one party drawing sleighs loaded
with baggage, I advanced to-day about four
miles along the trail, and encamped at the first
grassy spot, where we expected to bring our
horses. Mr. Fitzpatrick, with another party,
remained behind, to form an intermediate station
between us and the animals.</p>

<p>"Putting on our snow-shoes, we spent the
afternoon in exploring a road ahead. The
glare of the snow, combined with great fatigue,
had rendered many of the people nearly blind;
but we were fortunate in having some black
silk handkerchiefs, which, worn as veils, very
much relieved the eye.</p>

<p>"In the evening I received a message from
Mr. Fitzpatrick, acquainting me with the utter
failure of his attempt to get our mules and
horses over the snow&mdash;the half-hidden trail
had proved entirely too slight to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
them, and they had broken through, and were
plunging about or lying half buried in snow.
He was occupied in endeavoring to get them
back to his camp; and in the mean time sent
to me for further instructions. I wrote to him
to send the animals immediately back to their
old pastures; and, after having made mauls
and shovels, turn in all the strength of his
party to open and beat a road through the
snow, strengthening it with branches and
boughs of the pines.</p>

<p>"<i>February 12.</i>&mdash;We made mauls, and worked
hard at our end of the road all the day. The
wind was high, but the sun bright, and the
snow thawing. We worked down the face of
the hill, to meet the people at the other end.
Towards sundown it began to grow cold, and
we shouldered our mauls, and trudged back
to camp.</p>

<p>"<i>February 13.</i>&mdash;We continued to labor on
the road; and in the course of the day had the
satisfaction to see the people working down the
face of the opposite hill, about three miles distant.
During the morning we had the pleasure
of a visit from Mr. Fitzpatrick, with the
information that all was going on well. A
party of Indians had passed on snow-shoes,
who said they were going to the western side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of the mountain after fish. This was an indication
that the salmon were coming up the
streams; and we could hardly restrain our impatience
as we thought of them, and worked
with increased vigor.</p>

<p>"I was now perfectly satisfied that we had
struck the stream on which Mr. Sutter lived,
and turning about, made a hard push, and
reached the camp at dark. Here we had the
pleasure to find all the remaining animals,
57 in number, safely arrived at the grassy
hill near the camp; and here, also, we were
agreeably surprised with the sight of an
abundance of salt. Some of the horse guard
had gone to a neighboring hut for pine nuts,
and discovered unexpectedly a large cake of
very white fine-grained salt, which the Indians
told them they had brought from the
other side of the mountain; they used it to
eat with their pine nuts, and readily sold it
for goods.</p>

<p>"On the 19th, the people were occupied in
making a road and bringing up the baggage;
and, on the afternoon of the next day, <i>February</i>
20, 1844, we encamped with the animals
and all the <i>materiel</i> of the camp, on the summit
of the <span class="smcap">Pass</span> in the dividing ridge, 1,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
miles by our traveled road from the Dalles of
the Columbia.</p>

<p>"<i>February 21.</i>&mdash;We now considered ourselves
victorious over the mountain; having
only the descent before us, and the valley
under our eyes, we felt strong hope that we
should force our way down. But this was a
case in which the descent was <i>not</i> facile.
Still, deep fields of snow lay between, and
there was a large intervening space of rough-looking
mountains, through which we had
yet to wind our way. Carson roused me this
morning with an early fire, and we were all
up long before day, in order to pass the
snow fields before the sun should render the
crust soft. We enjoyed this morning a scene
at sunrise, which, even here, was unusually
glorious and beautiful. Immediately above
the eastern mountains was repeated a cloud-formed
mass of purple ranges, bordered with
bright yellow gold; the peaks shot up into a
narrow line of crimson cloud, above which
the air was filled with a greenish orange;
and over all was the singular beauty of the
blue sky. Passing along a ridge which
commanded the lake on our right, of which
we began to discover an outlet through a
chasm on the west, we passed over alternating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
open ground and hard-crusted snow-fields
which supported the animals, and encamped
on the ridge after a journey of six miles.
The grass was better than we had yet seen,
and we were encamped in a clump of trees,
twenty or thirty feet high, resembling white
pine.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

<p>"We had hard and doubtful labor yet before
us, as the snow appeared to be heavier where
the timber began further down, with few open
spots. Ascending a height, we traced out the
best line we could discover for the next day's
march, and had at least the consolation to see
that the mountain descended rapidly. The
day had been one of April; gusty, with a few
occasional flakes of snow; which, in the afternoon,
enveloped the upper mountains in
clouds. We watched them anxiously, as now
we dreaded a snow storm. Shortly afterwards
we heard the roll of thunder, and looking
toward the valley, found it all enveloped in a
thunder-storm. For us, as connected with the
idea of summer, it had a singular charm; and
we watched its progress with excited feelings
until nearly sunset, when the sky cleared off
brightly, and we saw a shining line of water
directing its course towards another, a broader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and larger sheet. We knew that these could
be no other than the Sacramento and the bay
of San Francisco; but, after our long wandering
in rugged mountains, where so frequently
we had met with disappointments, and where
the crossing of every ridge displayed some
unknown lake or river, we were yet almost
afraid to believe that we were at last to escape
into the genial country of which we have heard
so many glowing descriptions, and dreaded
again to find some vast interior lake, whose
bitter waters would bring us disappointment.
On the southern shore of what appeared to be
the bay, could be traced the gleaming line
where entered another large stream; and again
the Buenaventura rose up in our mind.</p>

<p>"Carson had entered the valley along the
southern side of the bay, but the country then
was so entirely covered with water from snow
and rain, that he had been able to form no
correct impression of watercourses.</p>

<p>"We had the satisfaction to know that at
least there were people below. Fires were lit
up in the valley just at night, appearing to be
in answer to ours; and these signs of life renewed,
in some measure, the gayety of the
camp. They appeared so near, that we judged
them to be among the timber of some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
neighboring ridges; but, having them constantly
in view day after day, and night after
night, we afterwards found them to be fires that
had been kindled by the Indians among the
<i>tulares</i>, on the shore of the bay, eighty miles
distant.</p>

<p>"Axes and mauls were necessary to-day to
make a road through the snow. Going ahead
with Carson to reconnoitre the road, we reached
in the afternoon the river which made the
outlet of the lake. Carson sprang over, clear
across a place where the stream was compressed
among rocks, but the <i>parfleche</i> sole of
my moccasin glanced from the icy rock, and
precipitated me into the river. It was some
few seconds before I could recover myself in
the current, and Carson, thinking me hurt,
jumped in after me, and we both had an icy
bath. We tried to search a while for my gun,
which had been lost in the fall, but the cold
drove us out; and making a large fire on the
bank, after we had partially dried ourselves
we went back to meet the camp. We afterwards
found that the gun had been slung
under the ice which lined the banks of the
creek.</p>

<p>"The sky was clear and pure, with a sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
wind from the northeast, and the thermometer
2° below the freezing point.</p>

<p>"We continued down the south face of the
mountain; our road leading over dry ground,
we were able to avoid the snow almost entirely.
In the course of the morning, we struck a foot
path, which we were generally able to keep;
and the ground was soft to our animal's feet,
being sandy or covered with mould. Green
grass began to make its appearance, and occasionally
we passed a hill scatteringly covered
with it. The character of the forest continued
the same; and, among the trees, the pine with
sharp leaves and very large cones was abundant,
some of them being noble trees. We
measured one that had ten feet diameter,
though the height was not more than one hundred
and thirty feet. All along, the river was
a roaring torrent, its fall very great; and, descending
with a rapidity to which we had long
been strangers, to our great pleasure oak trees
appeared on the ridge, and soon became very
frequent; on these I remarked unusually great
quantities of misletoe.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<span class="caption">"MY MOCCASIN GLANCED FROM THE ICY ROCK, AND PRECIPITATED
ME INTO THE RIVER."</span>
</div>

<p>"The opposite mountain side was very steep
and continuous&mdash;unbroken by ravines, and
covered with pines and snow; while on the
side we were traveling, innumerable rivulets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
poured down from the ridge. Continuing on,
we halted a moment at one of these rivulets,
to admire some beautiful evergreen trees, resembling
live oak, which shaded the little
stream. They were forty to fifty feet high,
and two in diameter, with a uniform tufted
top; and the summer green of their beautiful
foliage, with the singing birds, and the sweet
summer wind which was whirling about the
dry oak leaves, nearly intoxicated us with delight;
and we hurried on, filled with excitement,
to escape entirely from the horrid region
of inhospitable snow, to the perpetual spring
of the Sacramento.</p>

<p>"<i>February 25.</i>&mdash;Believing that the difficulties
of the road were passed, and leaving Mr.
Fitzpatrick to follow slowly, as the condition
of the animals required, I started ahead this
morning with a party of eight, consisting (with
myself) of Mr. Preuss, and Mr. Talbot, Carson,
Derosier, Towns, Proue, and Jacob. We
took with us some of the best animals, and my
intention was to proceed as rapidly as possible
to the house of Mr. Sutter, and return to meet
the party with a supply of provisions and
fresh animals.</p>

<p>"Near nightfall we descended into the
steep ravine of a handsome creek thirty feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
wide, and I was engaged in getting the horses
up the opposite hill, when I heard a shout
from Carson, who had gone ahead a few hundred
yards&mdash;'Life yet,' said he, as he came up,
'life yet; I have found a hill side sprinkled
with grass enough for the night.' We drove
along our horses, and encamped at the place
about dark, and there was just room enough to
make a place for shelter on the edge of the
stream. Three horses were lost to-day&mdash;Proveau;
a fine young horse from the Columbia,
belonging to Charles Towns; and another Indian
horse which carried our cooking utensils;
the two former gave out, and the latter strayed
off into the woods as we reached the camp:
and Derosier, knowing my attachment to Proveau,
volunteered to go and bring him in.</p>

<p>"Carson and I climbed one of the nearest
mountains; the forest land still extended
ahead, and the valley appeared as far as ever.
The pack horse was found near the camp, but
Derosier did not get in.</p>

<p>"We began to be uneasy at Derosier's absence,
fearing he might have been bewildered in
the woods. Charles Towns, who had not yet recovered
his mind, went to swim in the river,
as if it was summer, and the stream placid,
when it was a cold mountain torrent foaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
among the rocks. We were happy to see Derosier
appear in the evening. He came in,
and sitting down by the fire, began to tell us
where he had been. He imagined he had
been gone several days, and thought we were
still at the camp where he had left us; and we
were pained to see that his mind was deranged.
It appeared that he had been lost in the mountain,
and hunger and fatigue, joined to weakness
of body, and fear of perishing in the
mountains had crazed him. The times were
severe when stout men lost their minds from
extremity of suffering&mdash;when horses died&mdash;and
when mules and horses, ready to die of starvation,
were killed for food. Yet there was no
murmuring or hesitation. In the mean time
Mr. Preuss continued on down the river, and
unaware that we had encamped so early in the
day, was lost. When night arrived and he
did not come in, we began to understand what
had happened to him; but it was too late to
make any search.</p>

<p>"<i>March 3.</i>&mdash;We followed Mr. Preuss's trail
for a considerable distance along the river,
until we reached a place where he had descended
to the stream below and encamped.
Here we shouted and fired guns, but received
no answer; and we concluded that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
pushed on down the stream. I determined to
keep out from the river, along which it was
nearly impracticable to travel with animals,
until it should form a valley. At every step
the country improved in beauty; the pines
were rapidly disappearing, and oaks became
the principal trees of the forest. Among
these, the prevailing tree was the evergreen
oak (which, by way of distinction, we shall call
the <i>live oak</i>); and with these, occurred frequently
a new species of oak, bearing a long,
slender acorn, from an inch to an inch and a
half in length, which we now began to see
formed the principal vegetable food of the
inhabitants of this region. In a short distance
we crossed a little rivulet, where were two old
huts, and near by were heaps of acorn hulls.
The ground round about was very rich, covered
with an exuberant sward of grass; and
we sat down for a while in the shade of the
oaks, to let the animals feed. We repeated
our shouts for Mr. Preuss; and this time we
were gratified with an answer. The voice
grew rapidly nearer, ascending from the river,
but when we expected to see him emerge, it
ceased entirely. We had called up some straggling
Indian&mdash;the first we had met, although
for two days back we had seen tracks&mdash;who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
mistaking us for his fellows, had been only
undeceived by getting close up. It would
have been pleasant to witness his astonishment;
he would not have been more frightened
had some of the old mountain spirits they
are so much afraid of suddenly appeared in
his path. Ignorant of the character of these
people, we had now additional cause of uneasiness
in regard to Mr. Preuss; he had no arms
with him, and we began to think his chance
doubtful. Occasionally we met deer, but had
not the necessary time for hunting. At one
of these orchard grounds, we encamped about
noon to make an effort for Mr. Preuss. One
man took his way along a spur leading into
the river, in hope to cross his trail; and another
took our own back. Both were volunteers;
and to the successful man was promised
a pair of pistols&mdash;not as a reward, but as a
token of gratitude for a service which would
free us all from much anxiety."</p>

<p>It was not until the 6th, and after a continuation
of the most incredible sufferings, already
narrated, that the party reached Sutter's Fort,
where, it is needless to say, they were warmly
and cordially received by that gentleman,&mdash;and
to close this stirring narrative, we will only
add as an evidence of the terrible sufferings to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
which they had been subjected, that out of
sixty-seven horses and mules with which the
expedition was commenced, only thirty-three
reached the valley of the Sacramento, and they
had to be led. In quoting above from Fremont's
narrative, a continuous record has not
been kept, as we have used only such portions
as contain the narrative of incidents directly
connected with the expedition, and of which,
though scarcely mentioned throughout, save in
the most incidental manner, Carson might well
say, and with pride, <i>magna pars fui</i>.</p>

<p>In the course of this narrative we have frequently
used the word <i>cache</i>, and a brief interpretation
of its meaning, we are sure will not
be uninteresting to the uninitiated.</p>

<p>A cache is a term common among traders
and hunters, to designate a hiding place for
provisions and effects. It is derived from the
French word <i>cacher</i>, to conceal, and originated
among the early colonists of Canada and
Louisiana; but the secret depository which it
designates was in use among the aboriginals
long before the intrusion of the white men. It
is, in fact, the only mode that migratory hordes
have of preserving their valuables from robbery,
during their long absences from their
villages or accustomed haunts on hunting expeditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
or during the vicissitudes of war.
The utmost skill and caution are required to
render these places of concealment invisible to
the lynx eye of an Indian.</p>

<p>The first care is to seek out a proper situation,
which is generally some dry low bank
of clay, on the margin of a water course. As
soon as the precise spot is pitched upon, blankets,
saddle-cloths, and other coverings are
spread over the surrounding grass and bushes,
to prevent foot tracks, or any other derangement;
and as few hands as possible are employed.
A circle of about two feet in diameter
is then nicely cut in the sod, which is carefully
removed, with the loose soil immediately
beneath it, and laid aside in a place where it
will be safe from any thing that may change
its appearance. The uncovered area is then
digged perpendicularly to the depth of about
three feet, and is then gradually widened so as
to form a conical chamber six or seven feet
deep.</p>

<p>The whole of the earth displaced by this
process, being of a different color from that on
the surface, is handed up in a vessel, and
heaped into a skin or cloth, in which it is conveyed
to the stream and thrown into the midst
of the current, that it may be entirely carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
off. Should the cache not be formed in the
vicinity of a stream, the earth thus thrown up
is carried to a distance, and scattered in such
a manner as not to leave the minutest trace.
The cave being formed, is well lined with dry
grass, bark, sticks, and poles, and occasionally
a dried hide. The property intended to be
hidden is then laid in, after having been well
aired: a hide is spread over it, and dried grass,
brush, and stones thrown in, and trampled
down until the pit is filled to the neck. The
loose soil which had been put aside is then
brought, and rammed down firmly, to prevent
its caving in, and is frequently sprinkled with
water to destroy the scent, lest the wolves and
bears should be attracted to the place, and
root up the concealed treasure.</p>

<p>When the neck of the cache is nearly level
with the surrounding surface, the sod is again
fitted in with the utmost exactness, and any
bushes, stocks, or stones, that may have originally
been about the spot, are restored to their
former places. The blankets and other coverings
are then removed from the surrounding
herbage: all tracks are obliterated: the grass
is gently raised by the hand to its natural position,
and the minutest chip or straw is scrupulously
gleaned up and thrown into the stream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
After all is done, the place is abandoned for
the night, and, if all be right next morning, is
not visited again, until there be a necessity for
reopening the cache. Four men are sufficient
in this way, to conceal the amount of three
tons weight of merchandize in the course of
two days.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<p>Carson had passed the autumn and winter
with his family, in the society of old companions,
amid various incidents amusing to the
reader if they were detailed, because so unlike
the style of life to which he has been accustomed,
the particulars of which we must however
leave to his imagination, aiding it by
some general description of the customs of the
country and locality.</p>

<p>The town of Taos is the second in size in
New Mexico, (Santa Fe claiming of right to be
first,) with very little regard to beauty in its
construction, the houses being huddled upon
narrow streets, except in the immediate vicinity
of the <i>plaza</i>, on which are located the church
and the better class of houses; and where, as
in all Mexican towns, the marketing is carried
on. It is situated in the centre of the valley
of Taos, which is about thirty miles long, and
fifteen broad, and surrounded by mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
upon whose tops snow lies during the greater
part of the year.</p>

<p>The valley appears to be a plain, but is intersected
by many ravines, which flow into the
Rio Grande on its western side. There is no
timber, but in the mountains it is abundant,
and of excellent quality. The population in
the whole valley numbers scarcely more than
ten thousand, and as their farming operations
require but a portion of the soil, the larger
part of the land is still wild, and grazed only
by horses, cattle, and sheep, which are raised
in large numbers.</p>

<p>They are obliged to expend much labor upon
their crops, as the climate is too dry to mature
them without irrigation; and yet in their community
of interest, in a country without fences,
they find much satisfaction in rendering kind
offices to each other; and social life is more cultivated
than in communities whose interests
are more separate. The high altitude, and
dryness of the atmosphere, render the climate
exceedingly healthful, rather severe in winter,
but very mild and salubrious in summer, so
that disease is scarcely known in the valley.</p>

<p>The dress of the people has changed very
much since the population became partially
Americanized, so that often the buckskin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
pants have given place to cloth, and the blanket
to the coat, and the moccasin to the
leathern shoe, and the dress of the women has
undergone as great a change. They are learning
to employ American implements for agriculture,
instead of the rude Egyptian yoke fastened
to the horns of the oxen; and the plough
composed of a single hooked piece of timber,
and the axe that more resembles a pick, than
the axe of the American woodsman; and the
cart, whose wheels are pieces sawed from the
butt end of a log, with a hole bored for the
axle, whose squeaking can be heard for miles,
and which are themselves a sufficient burden
without any loading. Their diet is simple, as
it is with all Mexicans, consisting of the products
of the locality, with game, which is always
to be included in a bill of fare such as Carson
would furnish; corn, and wheat, and peas,
beans, eggs, pumpkins, and apples, pears,
peaches, plums, and grapes, constitute the
principal products of their culture. Their
great source of enjoyment is dancing, and the
fandango is so much an institution in a town
of the size of Taos, that, during the winter,
scarcely a night passes without a dance.
This is doubtless familiar to the reader, as the
acquisition of California has introduced a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
knowledge of the customs of its natives to
every eastern household.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1845, Carson had decided
to commence the business of farming at Taos,
and had made the necessary arrangements for
building a house, and for stocking and planting,
when an express arrived from Col. Fremont,
bringing despatches to remind him of
his promise to join a third exploring expedition,
in case he should ever undertake another,
and to designate the place where he would
meet the party Fremont was organising.</p>

<p>Before parting with Fremont in the previous
summer, Fremont had secured the promise
from Carson, that he would again be his guide
and companion, should he ever undertake
another expedition; but Carson was not expecting
its execution at this time, and yet,
though it would entail severe loss on him to
make a hasty sale of his possessions, and arrange
for leaving his family, he felt bound by
his promise, as well as by his attachment to
Fremont, and at once closing up his business,
together with an old friend by the name of
Owens, who had become, as it were, a partner
with him in his enterprise of farming, they
having been old trapping friends, they repaired
together to the point designated for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
joining the exploring party, upon the upper
Arkansas, at Bent's Fort, where they had last
parted from Fremont.</p>

<p>The meeting was mutually satisfactory, and
with Fremont were Maxwell, an old and well-tried
friend, and a Mr. Walker, who had been
in Captain Bonneville's expedition to the
Columbia, and in other trapping parties in
California and vicinity, so that with other
mountain men, whose names are less known,
but every man of whom was Carson's friend,
Fremont's corps was more efficient for the present
service, than it had been in either of the
former expeditions.</p>

<p>After some months spent in examining the
head-waters of the great rivers which flow to
either ocean, the party descended at the beginning
of winter to the Great Salt Lake, and in
October encamped on its southwestern shore, in
view of that undescribed country which at that
time had not been penetrated, and which vague
and contradictory reports of Indians represented
as a desert without grass or water.</p>

<p>Their previous visit to the lake had given it
a somewhat familiar aspect, and on leaving it
they felt as if about to commence their journey
anew. Its eastern shore was frequented by
large bands of Indians, but here they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
dwindled down to a single family, which was
gleaning from some hidden source, enough to
support life, and drinking the salt water of a
little stream near by, no fresh water being
at hand. This offered scanty encouragement
as to what they might expect on the desert
beyond.</p>

<p>At its threshold and immediately before
them was a naked plain of smooth clay surface,
mostly devoid of vegetation&mdash;the hazy weather
of the summer hung over it, and in the distance
rose scattered, low, black and dry-looking
mountains. At what appeared to be fifty miles
or more, a higher peak held out some promise
of wood and water, and towards this it was resolved
to direct their course.</p>

<p>Four men, with a pack animal loaded with
water for two days, and accompanied by a
naked Indian&mdash;who volunteered for a reward
to be their guide to a spot where he said there
was grass and fine springs&mdash;were sent forward
to explore in advance for a foothold, and verify
the existence of water before the whole party
should be launched into the desert. Their way
led toward the high peak of the mountain, on
which they were to make a smoke signal in the
event of finding water. About sunset of the
second day, no signal having been seen, Fremont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
became uneasy at the absence of his men, and
set out with the whole party upon their trail,
traveling rapidly all the night. Towards
morning one of the scouts was met returning.</p>

<p>The Indian had been found to know less
than themselves, and had been sent back, but
the men had pushed on to the mountains, where
they found a running stream, with wood and
sufficient grass. The whole party now lay
down to rest, and the next day, after a hard
march, reached the stream. The distance
across the plain was nearly seventy miles, and
they called the mountain which had guided
them Pilot Peak. This was their first day's
march and their first camp in the desert.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards the expedition was
divided into two parties&mdash;the larger one under
the guidance of Walker, a well-known mountaineer
and experienced traveler, going around
to the foot of the Sierra Nevada by a circuitous
route which he had previously traveled, and
Fremont, with ten men, Delawares and whites,
penetrated directly through the heart of the
desert.</p>

<p>Some days after this separation, Fremont's
party, led by Carson, while traveling along the
foot of a mountain, the arid country covered
with dwarf shrubs, discovered a volume of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
smoke rising from a ravine. Riding cautiously
up, they discovered a single Indian on the
border of a small creek. He was standing
before a little fire, naked as he was born, apparently
thinking, and looking at a small
earthen pot which was simmering over the fire,
filled with the common ground-squirrel of the
country. Another bunch of squirrels lay near
it, and close by were his bow and arrows. He
was a well-made, good-looking young man,
about twenty-five years of age. Although so
taken by surprise that he made no attempt to
escape, and evidently greatly alarmed, he received
his visitors with forced gaiety, and
offered them part of his <i>pot au feu</i> and his
bunch of squirrels. He was kindly treated
and some little presents made him, and the
party continued their way.</p>

<p>His bow was handsomely made, and the arrows,
of which there were about forty in his
quiver, were neatly feathered, and headed with
obsidian, worked into spear-shape by patient
labor.</p>

<p>After they had separated, Fremont found
that his Delawares had taken a fancy to the
Indian's bow and arrows, and carried them off.
They carried them willingly back, when they
were reminded that they had exposed the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
fellow to almost certain starvation by depriving
him, in the beginning of winter, of his only
means of subsistence, which it would require
months to replace.</p>

<p>One day the party had reached one of the
lakes lying along the foot of the Sierra Nevada,
which was their appointed rendezvous with
their friends, and where, at this season, the
scattered Indians of the neighborhood were
gathering, to fish. Turning a point on the lake
shore, a party of Indians, some twelve or fourteen
in number, came abruptly in view. They
were advancing along in Indian file, one following
the other, their heads bent forward, with
eyes fixed on the ground. As the two parties
met, the Indians did not turn their heads or
raise their eyes from the ground, but passed
silently along. The whites, habituated to the
chances of savage life, and always uncertain
whether they should find friends or foes in
those they met, fell readily into their humor,
and they too passed on their way without word
or halt.</p>

<p>It was a strange meeting: two parties of
such different races and different countries,
coming abruptly upon each other, with every
occasion to excite curiosity and provoke question,
pass in a desert without a word of inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
or a single remark on either side, or without
any show of hostility.</p>

<p>Walker's party joined Fremont at the
appointed rendezvous, at the point where
Walker's river discharges itself into the lake,
but it was now mid-winter, they were out of
provisions&mdash;and there was no guide. The
heavy snows might be daily expected to block
up the passes in the great Sierra, if they had
not already fallen, and with all their experience
it was considered too hazardous to attempt the
passage with the <i>materiel</i> of a whole party; it
was arranged therefore that Walker should
continue with the main party southward along
the Sierra, and enter the valley of the San
Joaquin by some one of the low passes at its
head, where there is rarely or never snow.
Fremont undertook, with a few men, to cross
directly westward over the Sierra Nevada to
Sutter's Fort, with the view of obtaining there
the necessary supplies of horses and beef cattle
with which to rejoin his party.</p>

<p>After some days' travel, leaving the Mercedes
River, they had entered among the foothills of
the mountains, and were journeying through
a beautiful country of undulating upland,
openly timbered with oaks, principally evergreen,
and watered with small streams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Traveling along, they came suddenly upon
broad and deeply-worn trails, which had been
freshly traveled by large bands of horses, apparently
coming from the settlements on the
coast. These and other indications warned
them that they were approaching villages of the
Horse-Thief Indians, who appeared to have
just returned from a successful foray. With
the breaking up of the missions, many of the
Indians had returned to their tribes in the
mountains. Their knowledge of the Spanish
language, and familiarity with the ranches and
towns, enabled them to pass and repass, at
pleasure, between their villages in the Sierra
and the ranches on the coast. They very soon
availed themselves of these facilities to steal
and run off into the mountains bands of horses,
and in a short time it became the occupation
of all the Indians inhabiting the southern
Sierra Nevada, as well as the plains beyond.</p>

<p>Three or four parties would be sent at a time
from different villages, and every week was
signalized by the carrying-off of hundreds of
horses, to be killed and eaten in the interior.
Repeated expeditions had been made against
them by the Californians, who rarely succeeded
in reaching the foot of the mountains, and were
invariably defeated when they did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
As soon as this fresh trail had been discovered,
four men, two Delawares with Maxwell
and Dick Owens, two of Fremont's favorite
men, were sent forward upon the trail. The
rest of the party had followed along at their
usual gait, but Indian signs became so thick,
trail after trail joining on, that they started
rapidly after the men, fearing for their safety.
After a few miles ride, they reached a spot
which had been the recent camping ground of
a village, and where abundant grass and good
water suggested a halting place for the night,
and they immediately set about unpacking
their animals and preparing to encamp.</p>

<p>While thus engaged, they heard what seemed
to be the barking of many dogs, coming apparently
from a village, not far distant; but they
had hardly thrown off their saddles when they
suddenly became aware that it was the noise
of women and children shouting and crying;
and this was sufficient notice that the men who
had been sent ahead had fallen among unfriendly
Indians, so that a fight had already
commenced.</p>

<p>It did not need an instant to throw the saddles
on again, and leaving four men to guard
the camp, Fremont, with the rest, rode off in
the direction of the sounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
They had galloped but half a mile, when
crossing a little ridge, they came abruptly in
view of several hundred Indians advancing on
each side of a knoll, on the top of which were
the men, where a cluster of trees and rocks
made a good defence. It was evident that they
had come suddenly into the midst of the Indian
village, and jumping from their horses, with
the instinctive skill of old hunters and mountaineers
as they were, had got into an admirable
place to fight from.</p>

<p>The Indians had nearly surrounded the
knoll, and were about getting possession of the
horses, as Fremont's party came in view.
Their welcome shout as they charged up the
hill, was answered by the yell of the Delawares
as they dashed down to recover their animals,
and the crack of Owens' and Maxwell's rifles.
Owens had singled out the foremost Indian
who went headlong down the hill, to steal
horses no more.</p>

<p>Profiting by the first surprise of the Indians,
and anxious for the safety of the men who had
been left in camp, the whites immediately retreated
towards it, checking the Indians with
occasional rifle shots, with the range of which
it seemed remarkable that they were acquainted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
The whole camp were on guard until daylight.
As soon as it was dark, each man crept
to his post. They heard the women and children
retreating towards the mountains, but
nothing disturbed the quiet of the camp, except
when one of the Delawares shot at a wolf as it
jumped over a log, and which he mistook for
an Indian. As soon as it grew light they took
to the most open ground, and retreated into
the plain.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

<p>The record of Fremont and Carson's journey
through this region of country, already so
thoroughly explored at such great hazard, and
accompanied with such unheard-of sufferings,
would be but a repetition of what has already
been written, for they were again driven to
mule meat, or whatever else chance or Providence
might throw in their way, to sustain life.
In every need&mdash;in every peril&mdash;in every quarter
where coolness, sagacity, and skill were
most required, Carson was ever first, and his
conduct throughout cemented, if possible, more
firmly the friendship between him and his
young commander.</p>

<p>They reached, at last, Sutter's Fort, where
they were received with the hospitality which
has made Mr. Sutter's name proverbial; and
leaving his party to recruit there, Fremont
pushed on towards Monterey, to make known
to the authorities there the condition of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
party, and obtained permission to recruit and
procure the supplies necessary for the prosecution
of his exploration.</p>

<p>Journeying in the security of this permission,
he was suddenly arrested in his march, near
Monterey, by an officer at the head of a body
of cavalry, who bore him a violent message
from the commanding officer in California&mdash;Gen.
Castro&mdash;commanding him to retire instantly
from the country.</p>

<p>There was now no alternative but to put
himself on the defensive, as he had come to the
country for an entirely peaceable purpose, and
it was not in the blood of Americans to submit
to dictation. The direction of travel was therefore
changed; a strong point was selected and
fortified as thoroughly as could be with the
means at their command, which work was
hardly completed before Gen. Castro, at the
head of several hundred men, arrived and established
his camp within a few hundred yards
and in sight of the exploring party, evidently
under the mistaken idea that he could intimidate
them by his numbers.</p>

<p>Though the Americans were but forty in
number, every man had already seen service,
and the half score of old traders and trappers,
who had been leaders in many an Indian fight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
made the party, small as it was, quite equal to
that of the ten fold greater number of the
Mexicans; for the men, equally with their
leader, were determined to maintain their
rights, and if need be, to sacrifice their lives
in defence of the cause of American citizens
in Mexico; for in the three days during which
they lay there encamped, expresses came in
from the American citizens in Monterey, warning
them of their danger, and announcing too,
the probability of a war with Mexico, and
urging the propriety that every American
should unite in a common defence against the
Mexican authorities.</p>

<p>At the end of three days the council which
Fremont now called, agreed with him, that the
Mexican General had no intention of attacking
them, and that it was the more prudent course
to break up camp, push on to the Sacramento
River, and endeavor at Lawson's trading post
to obtain the needed outfit for their return
homeward through Oregon, as further exploration
in southern California seemed out of the
question; and because, as an officer in the
United States service, Fremont felt he could
not commence, or willingly court hostility with
the Mexican authorities&mdash;besides, all the American
residents in the country were equally in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
peril; and if the event of war pressed upon
them, preparation was needed, and should be
made at once.</p>

<p>In council Fremont found Carson ready for
such, as for every emergency; and, around the
camp fires, where the subject was discussed,
every man was ready for the affray; and while
willing to retire and wait the command of the
leader evinced no disposition to avoid it.</p>

<p>The party remained ten days at Lawson's
post, when information was brought that the
Indians were in arms at the instigation of the
Mexicans, as it was supposed, and were advancing
to destroy the post, and any other American
settlement; and it was soon rumored that
a thousand warriors were collected, and on
their way to aid in this purpose. The time
had now come for action, and, with five men
from the post, Captain Fremont and his command,
with Carson for his Lieutenant, by
choice of the party, as well as of its leader,
took up their march against the savages, in aid
of their countrymen.</p>

<p>They had no difficulty in finding the Indian
war party, and immediately made the attack,
which was responded to with vigor by the Indians,
and contested bravely; but, of course,
with inability to conquer. The red men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
defeated with terrible slaughter, and learned
here the lesson not forgotten for many years,
that it was useless to measure their strength
with white men.</p>

<p>Carson was, of course, as was his invariable
custom, in the thickest of the fight, and when
it was over, and the Indians had retired, cowed
and defeated, ventured the opinion that they
had received a lesson which would not be required
to be repeated in many years.</p>

<p>This victory won, and present danger from
these Indians thus avoided, the party returned
to Lawson's post, where, having completed
their outfit, they turned their backs on Mexican
possessions, and started northward, Fremont
looking to Oregon as the field of his
future operations, intending to explore a new
route to the Wah-lah-math settlements.</p>

<p>While on that journey, Carson being as ever
his guide, companion, and friend, the party
was suddenly surprised by the appearance of
two white men, who, as all knew from experience,
must have incurred the greatest perils
and hazards to reach that spot.</p>

<p>They proved to be two of Mr. Fremont's
old <i>voyageurs</i>, and quickly told their story.
They were part of a guard of six men conducting
a United States officer, who was on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
trail with despatches from Washington, and
whom they had left two days back, while they
came on to give notice of his approach, and to
ask that assistance might be sent him. They
themselves had only escaped the Indians by
the swiftness of their horses. It was a case in
which there was no time to be lost, nor a mistake
made. Mr. Fremont determined to go
himself; and taking ten picked men, Carson
of course accompanying him, he rode down the
western shore of the lake on the morning of
the 9th, (the direction the officer was to come,)
and made a journey of sixty miles without a
halt. But to meet men, and not to miss them,
was the difficult point in this trackless region.
It was not the case of a high road, where all
travelers must meet in passing each other: at
intervals there were places&mdash;defiles, or camping
grounds&mdash;where both parties might pass; and
watching for these, he came to one in the afternoon,
and decided that, if the party was not
killed, it must be there that night. He halted
and encamped; and, as the sun was going
down, had the inexpressible satisfaction to see
the four men approaching. The officer proved
to be Lieutenant Gillespie, of the United
States marines, who had been despatched from
Washington the November previous, to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
his way by Vera Cruz, the City of Mexico, and
Mazatlan, to Monterey, in Upper California,
deliver despatches to the United States consul
there; and then find Mr. Fremont, wherever
he should be.</p>

<p>Carson, in a letter to the Washington Union
in June 1847, thus describes the interview, and
the events consequent upon it:</p>

<p>"Mr. Gillespie had brought the Colonel letters
from home&mdash;the first he had had since
leaving the States the year before&mdash;and he was
up, and kept a large fire burning until after
midnight; the rest of us were tired out, and
all went to sleep. This was the only night in
all our travels, except the one night on the
island in the Salt Lake, that we failed to keep
guard; and as the men were so tired, and we
expected no attack now that we had sixteen in
the party, the Colonel didn't like to ask it of
them, but sat up late himself. Owens and I
were sleeping together, and we were waked at
the same time by the licks of the axe that
killed our men. At first, I didn't know it was
that; but I called to Basil, who was on that side&mdash;'What's
the matter there?&mdash;What's that
fuss about?'&mdash;he never answered, for he was
dead then, poor fellow, and he never knew
what killed him&mdash;his head had been cut in, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
his sleep; the other groaned a little as he
died. The Delawares (we had four with us)
were sleeping at that fire, and they sprang up
as the Tlamaths charged them. One of them
caught up a gun, which was unloaded; but,
although he could do no execution, he kept
them at bay, fighting like a soldier, and didn't
give up until he was shot full of arrows&mdash;three
entering his heart; he died bravely. As
soon as I had called out, I saw it was Indians
in the camp, and I and Owens together cried
out 'Indians.' There were no orders given;
things went on too fast, and the Colonel had
men with him that didn't need to be told their
duty. The Colonel and I, Maxwell, Owens,
Godey, and Stepp, jumped together, we six,
and ran to the assistance of our Delawares. I
don't know who fired and who didn't; but I
think it was Stepp's shot that killed the
Tlamath chief; for it was at the crack of
Stepp's gun that he fell. He had an English
half-axe slung to his wrist by a cord, and there
were forty arrows left in his quiver&mdash;the most
beautiful and warlike arrows I ever saw. He
must have been the bravest man among them,
from the way he was armed, and judging by
his cap. When the Tlamaths saw him fall,
they ran; but we lay, every man with his rifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
cocked, until daylight, expecting another attack.</p>

<p>"In the morning we found by the tracks
that from fifteen to twenty of the Tlamaths
had attacked us. They had killed three of our
men, and wounded one of the Delawares, who
scalped the chief, whom we left where he fell.
Our dead men we carried on mules; but, after
going about ten miles, we found it impossible
to get them any farther through the thick timber,
and finding a secret place, we buried them
under logs and chunks, having no way to dig
a grave. It was only a few days before this
fight that some of these same Indians had
come into our camp; and, although we had
only meat for two days, and felt sure that we
should have to eat mules for ten or fifteen
days to come, the Colonel divided with them,
and even had a mule unpacked to give them
some tobacco and knives."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<p>Those who have not been in similar dangers
cannot properly appreciate the feelings of the
survivors, as they watched with their dead and
performed for them the last sad rites. Fremont
had lost Lajeunesse, whom they all loved,
and the other two, Crane and the Delaware
Indian, were not less brave than he. The Indians
had watched for Lieutenant Gillespie,
but in Fremont's coming up, while three were
taken, more were saved, and the benefit to the
country, and perhaps the safety to Fremont's
whole force was secured by the receipt of the
dispatches, and this early rencontre. None
had apprehended danger that night, being, as
they erroneously supposed, far removed from
the Tlamath country, and equally far from the
point where they already had encountered and
defeated the red men. The Indians never
again found Fremont's party off guard, for the
events of this night proved a serious and melancholy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
as well as a sufficient lesson. That
they cherished revenge, is not to be wondered
at, nor that they vowed to seek it at the
earliest opportunity, as it was now known that
war had been declared with Mexico, for such
was the tenor of Lieut. Gillespie's information.
Fremont determined to return to California,
and choosing to give his men a chance for revenge
before doing so, he traveled around
Tlamath lake, and, camping at a spot nearly
opposite where his three men had been killed,
the next morning sent Carson on in advance,
with ten chosen men, and with instructions
that, if he discovered a large Indian village,
without being seen himself, he should send
back word, and that he would hasten on with
the rest of the party and give them battle;
but if this could not be done, to attack the
village himself, if he thought the chances were
equal.</p>

<p>Of course Carson and his men were parties
to this advice, choosing the situation of danger
because only in that way could they revenge
the death of their comrades.</p>

<p>They were not long in finding a trail, which
they followed to a village of fifty lodges, in
each of which were probably three warriors.
The village was in commotion, which indicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
that they had discovered Carson and his party;
so that no time could be lost, and Carson and
his comrades at once determined to take advantage
of the confusion in which the Indian
camp seemed to be, by making a sudden
charge.</p>

<p>The Indians had their families to defend, and
were brave in proportion as that motive is an
incentive to activity, therefore the attack of the
white men was received and met with desperation.
But a panic of fear seized them, owing
to the suddenness of the attack, and they fled,
leaving behind them all their possessions, while
the victors pursued and shot them down without
mercy, and when the victory was declared
complete by their leader Carson, they returned
to the richly-stored village. In all their travels
and adventures, they had never seen an Indian
village in which the lodges were more tasteful
in their workmanship and their decorations, or
which were better supplied with utensils of convenience.
The wigwams were woven of the
broad leaves of a kind of flag which was highly
combustible. Carson therefore ordered that
they should be burned, having first visited them
to see that their contents were so arranged as
to be consumed in the conflagration. The
work was completed in a few moments and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Fremont, seeing the smoke, knew that Carson
was engaged with the Indians, and hastened
forward to render him any needed assistance.
But he arrived only to hear the report of his
lieutenant, and to have the gloom of the whole
party dispelled by the news of the victory accomplished;
and to move on a little for an encampment,
and a talk in regard to their future
operations.</p>

<p>The next day all started for the valley of the
Sacramento, and were four days out from their
camp when they came to a point on the river
where it passes through a deep cañon, through
which the trail would take them, but Carson
advised to avoid this gorge, and they were wise
in doing so, as Tlamath Indians were concealed
there, intending to cut off the party of white
men. Disappointed that they had lost their
prey, the Indians came out from this ambush,
and were immediately dispersed by Carson and
Godey, and a few others, who made a charge
upon them. But one old Indian, inspired
probably by revenge for some friend lost, stood
his ground, and with several arrows in his
mouth waited the attack he courted. Carson
and Godey advanced, and when within shooting
distance, were obliged to dodge rapidly to avoid
the arrows leveled at them. The Indian was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
behind a tree, and only by cautiously advancing
while dodging the death he was sending from
his bow, did Carson gain a position where he
was able to aim a bullet at his heart. The
beautiful bow and still unexhausted quiver that
Carson took from this Indian, he presented to
Lieutenant Gillespie on his return to camp.</p>

<p>They were in a locality where game was
scarce, not being able to find any, the whole
party went supperless that night and breakfastless
next morning, but the next day they found
some game, and came, after severe traveling
for some days longer, safely in to Peter Lawson's
Fort, where they rested and hunted a
week, and then moved lower down on the Sacramento,
and again camped. But his men
were restless from inactivity, and Fremont decided
it was no longer wise to wait for positive
instructions, as the war was probably commenced;
he therefore sent a part of his force
to take the little town and fort at Sonoma,
which had but a weak garrison. They captured
General Vallejos here, with two captains and
several cannon, and a quantity of arms. The
whole force united at Sonoma, and learning
that the Mexicans and Americans in the south
were engaged in open hostility, Fremont was
preparing to join them, calling in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Americans in the vicinity to come to his command,
when a large Mexican force, dispatched
by General Castro from San Francisco, with
orders to drive the Americans out of the country,
came into the vicinity, and took prisoners and
killed two men, whom Fremont had sent out
as messengers to the American settlers, to inform
them that Sonoma was taken, and that
they could fly thither for safety.</p>

<p>The captain of this party of Mexicans, hearing
that Fremont and his forces were anxious
to attack him, lost all courage and fled, to be
pursued by the party of explorers, who followed
them closely for six days, and captured
many horses which they had abandoned in
their fright. But finding they could not overtake
them, Fremont returned to Sonoma, and
the party of Mexicans continued their march
to Los Angelos, where General Castro joined
them.</p>

<p>Around Fremont's party, the American citizens
now rallied in great numbers&mdash;nearly all
who were in the country&mdash;knowing that their
time to aid in its emancipation had arrived.
Fremont left a strong garrison at Sonoma, and
went to Sutter's Fort, where he left his prisoners,
General Vallejos and the two captains,
and an American, a brother-in-law of General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Vallejos, and having put the fort under military
rules, with all his mountain men, started to
take possession of Monterey. But he had been
anticipated in this work by Commodore Sloat,
who was in port with the American squadron,
and who left soon after Fremont's arrival,
Commodore Stockton assuming the command.</p>

<p>While at Sonoma, Fremont and his mountain
men, with the American settlers, had declared
the Independence of California, and
assumed the Bear Flag, which he gallantly
tendered to Commodore Sloat, and the flag of
the United States was hoisted over his camp.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>

<p>With Carson as his constant adviser, as he
was now his acknowledged friend, Fremont
here obtained the use of the ship Cyanne, to
convey himself and his command to San Diego,
where they hoped to be able to obtain animals,
and march upon the Mexicans under General
Castro, who was then at Los Angelos, leaving
their own for the use of Commodore Stockton
and his marines, who were to meet them at
that place.</p>

<p>With the Americans who joined him at San
Diego, all of them pioneers of the true stamp,
inured to hardships, hard fare, and Indian
fights, Fremont's command numbered one
hundred and fifty men, who started for Los
Angelos, with perfect confidence in their own
success, though the force of the enemy was
seven or eight hundred.</p>

<p>Fremont camped a league from this beautiful
town, to await the arrival of the Commodore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
who soon joined him, with "as fine a body of
men as I ever looked upon," to quote Carson's
own words, and the forces thus united, marched
at once upon Los Angelos, which they found
deserted, as General Castro dared not risk a
battle with such men as he knew Fremont
commanded.</p>

<p>After this, Fremont was appointed Governor
of California by Commodore Stockton, and returned
to Monterey and the northern portion
of the country, while the Commodore went to
San Diego, as that was a better port than San
Pedro, the port of Los Angelos; and General
Castro returned to the possession of Los Angelos.</p>

<p>Meantime, Carson, with a force of fifteen
men, was dispatched to make the overland
journey to Washington, as the bearer of important
dispatches. He was instructed to make
the journey in sixty days if possible, which he
felt sure of being able to accomplish, though
no one knew, better than he did, the difficulties
he might expect to encounter.</p>

<p>When two days out from the copper mines
of New Mexico, he came suddenly upon a
village of Apache Indians, which his quick wit
enabled him to elude. He rode forward in his
path, as if unmindful of their presence, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
halted in a wood a few yards from the village,
which seemed to disconcert the inhabitants,
unused to being approached with so much
boldness, as they had never been treated in
that manner by the Mexicans. He here demanded
a parley, which was granted, and he
told them that his party were simply travelers
on the road to New Mexico, and that they had
come to their village for an exchange of animals,
as theirs were nearly exhausted.</p>

<p>The Indians were satisfied with his explanation;
and Carson, choosing as his camping-ground
a suitable spot for defense, traded with
the Apaches to advantage, and at an early hour
on the following morning resumed his journey,
glad to be thus easily rid of such treacherous,
thieving rascals. A few more days of travel
brought him to the Mexican settlements, and
near to his own home and family. The party
had been, for some time, short of provisions, as
their haste in traveling did not allow them to
stop to hunt, and on the route&mdash;desert much
of the way&mdash;there had been little game; and
now, with only a little corn which they ate
parched, they were glad of relief, which Carson
readily obtained from friends at the first ranche
he entered; for though the country was at war
with the United States, Carson was a Mexican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
as much as an American, having chosen their
country for his home, and taken a wife from
their people. He was pursuing his course
towards Taos, when, across a broad prairie, he
espied a speck moving towards him, which his
eagle eye soon discerned could not belong to
the country. As it neared him, and its form
became visible, hastening on, he met an expedition
sent out by the United States Government
to operate in California, under the command
of General Kearney, to which officer he
lost no time in presenting himself, and narrated
to him his errand, and the state of affairs in
California, with the most graphic fidelity.
Kearney was extremely glad to meet him, and
after detaining him as long as Carson thought
it wise to remain, proposed to Carson to return
with him, while he should send the dispatches
to Washington by Mr. Fitzpatrick&mdash;with whom
Carson had a familiar acquaintance; and knowing
how almost invaluable his services would
be to General Kearney, Carson gave the ready
answer, "As the General pleases," trusting entirely
to his fidelity in the matter, and as the
exchange was a self-denial to him, he had no
occasion to weigh the motives that might influence
a man like General Kearney in the affair
of the dispatches, or the good that his presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
with them might be to himself when he should
arrive in Washington, but while he would have
been glad to have met his family, he cared for
the honor of having done his duty.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>

<p>On the 18th of October, Gen. Kearney took
up his march from his camp upon the Rio
Grande, having Christopher Carson for his
guide, with instructions to lead the party by
the most direct route to California: and so
ably did Carson fulfill this official duty, so unexpectedly
imposed upon him, that, with their
animals in good condition still, they camped
within the limit of California on the evening
of the third of December, and the next morning
advanced towards San Diego.</p>

<p>But the Mexicans were not unapprised of
the approach of American troops, and spies
sent out by General Castro, to meet Kearney's
force, were surprised and brought into camp
by a scout which Carson attended. Compelled
to give information, they said that the Mexican
forces under its general, were planning an
attack upon the Americans before they could
join their California allies. Carson, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
understanding he had of Gen. Kearney, and
his knowledge of guerrilla warfare, would have
advised another route, to evade the Mexican
troops and avoid a battle, until the weary and
newly arrived soldiery had had some rest, and
the assistance and advice of those who knew
the last movements of the Mexicans, could
make a battle more effectual with less of risk
than now; but General Kearney was impatient
for an encounter with the stupid Mexicans,
as he deemed them, and only learned by
experience that the Californians were superior
to those he had known in other of the Mexican
States, both in courage and natural tact, and in
their military order and discipline, as the story
will fully show.</p>

<p>He kept on his course until he approached
within fifteen miles of the Mexican camp,
where he halted, and despatched a party to
reconnoitre. They reported on their return,
that the enemy were strongly fortified in an
Indian village; but in making the observation
the scout had been discovered and pursued
back to camp.</p>

<p>General Kearney determined to make an
immediate attack, and commenced his march
at one o'clock in the morning, with no rest
that night for his animals or for his men; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
weary and hungry before day, when within a
mile of Castro's camp, the advance guard of
the Americans came upon the advance guard
of the Mexicans, which had been stationed to
prevent a surprise.</p>

<p>This Mexican guard slept in their dress,
ready at a five minutes' warning to mount in
their saddles, which were their pillows, while
their horses were tied to feed close around
them. The sound of the trumpet commanded
first a rapid trot, then a gallop, and
the fifteen Americans under Captain Johnson
with Kit Carson, of course, for his next officer,
had a brisk fight with this Mexican outpost,
but failed to stampede their animals, as each
Mexican mounted his own horse immediately,
and the guard drew back into camp. Capt.
Johnson and Carson were now joined by Capt.
Moore with twenty five Americans, a force
that had united with Kearney's since he
came into California, when Moore ordered an
attack upon the centre of the Mexican force,
in order to divide it, and cause confusion in
the Mexican ranks.</p>

<p>The command of forty men were within a
hundred yards of the enemy, and Carson
among the foremost, when his horse suddenly
fell and threw its rider, who was not seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
injured; but the stock of his gun was shivered
to splinters, and his position one of exceeding
danger, as the whole body of dragoons went
galloping over him. When he could arise
from the ground, he saw a dead horseman
lying near, whom he relieved of gun and
cartridge box, and again mounting his horse,
upon whose bridle he had managed to retain
his hold, he was speedily in the thickest of the
fight, where the contest was becoming desperate.</p>

<p>Capt. Johnson and several of the soldiers in
the advance had already been killed, and
probably only the fall of his horse had saved
Carson's life, but he was now able to assist
Moore and his men to dislodge the Mexicans,
and oblige them to retreat. The Americans
pursued them, but as there were only forty in
the whole of General Kearney's command who
were mounted on horses, and the mules which
were ridden by the rest had become at once
unmanageable when the firing commenced,
their success was not complete. The horses
they had were wild, having been captured by
Capt. Davidson and Kit Carson since their arrival
in California, from a party of Mexicans
bound for Sonora, so that even Moore's party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
had become scattered in the chase, and the
pursuit accomplished very little.</p>

<p>The Mexicans immediately discovered the
condition of the Americans, and turning back,
recommenced the fight, which had been nearly
a bloodless victory until now, but soon became
for the Americans, a terrible slaughter. Every
moment some dragoon yielded his life to the
bullet or the deadly blow of an exasperated
Mexican, and of the forty dragoons on horses
thirty were either killed or severely wounded.
Captain Moore, whom Carson calls, "as brave
a man as ever drew the breath of life," was
already among the killed. As fast as the
American soldiers could come up, they joined
the battle, but the Mexicans fought with a
bravery unsurpassed, and seemed to carry all
before them.</p>

<p>Gen. Kearney now drew his sword, and
placed himself at the head of his remaining
forces, and though severely wounded, attempted
to again force the Mexicans to retreat, while
Lieutenant Davidson came up with two mountain
howitzers; but before he could unlimber
them for use, the men who were working them
were shot down, and the lasso, thrown with
unerring aim, had captured the horses attached
to one of them, and the gun was taken to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
ranks of the enemy, who, for some reason,
could not make it go off, or the American
howitzer, at the distance of three hundred
yards, would have done execution against those
who had brought it thousands of miles to this
point, to have it turned against them; though
Lieutenant Davidson had nearly lost his life in
the attempt to save it, but to no purpose.</p>

<p>The Americans were now obliged to take
refuge at a point of rocks that offered, near
where they had been defeated, for they had but
two officers besides Carson, who were not either
killed or wounded; and here they waited for
the Mexicans, but they did not again venture
an attack.</p>

<p>The fighting had continued throughout the
entire day; both sides were weary and spent, and
night closed over this scene of battle, without
any positive result to either party. Gen.
Kearney must now attend to the wounded, and
all night the camp was occupied in the sad
work of burying its dead, and alleviating the
agony of the sufferers; while, at the same
time, a close watch was kept for the enemy,
who were constantly receiving reinforcements,
of Indians as well as Mexicans, from the
country around. A council of war was held,
which at once decided it was best to advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
toward San Diego in the morning, with the
hope of soon receiving additions to their forces.
Gen. Kearney had dispatched three men to San
Diego, with messages to Commodore Stockton,
and before the battle commenced, they had
come back within sight of their comrades,
when they were taken prisoners by the enemy;
and whether they had succeeded in getting
through to San Diego, Gen. Kearney did not
know. Early in the morning, the command
was again upon its way, with the following
order of march: Carson, with twenty-five still
able-bodied men, formed the advance, and the
remainder, a much crippled band of soldiers,
followed in the trail that he had made. Their
march was continued all the morning, in the
constant expectation of an attack from the
Mexicans, who were also moving on, sometimes
out of sight in the valleys, and sometimes seen
from the neighboring hills. When the first
opportunity occurred, Gen. Kearney demanded
a parley, and arranged to exchange a lieutenant,
whose horse had been shot from under him
during the battle, and who had consequently
fallen into the hands of the Americans, for one
of the express messengers the Mexicans were
detaining; but it availed nothing, for the expressman
stated that, finding it impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
reach San Diego, he and his companions had
returned, when they were captured by the
Mexicans.</p>

<p>The Mexicans had been man&oelig;uvering all
day, and toward evening, as the Americans
were about going into camp by a stream of
water, came down upon them in two divisions,
making a vigorous charge. The Americans
were obliged to retire before such vastly
superior numbers, and marched in order to a
hill a little distance off, where they halted to
give the Mexicans battle; but the latter, seeing
the advantage of the position, drew off to a
neighboring height, where they commenced and
continued a deadly cannonade upon the Americans.
A party of Americans was sent to dislodge
them, which they accomplished, and the
whole force of the Americans went over to
occupy that position, as they were compelled to
make a resting place somewhere, because it was
no longer possible for them to continue their
march, with the Mexican force ready at any
time to fall upon them. Upon this hill there
was barely water enough for the men, and to
take the horses to the stream could not be
thought of, for the Mexicans would surely capture
them; nor had they any food left, except
as they killed and ate their mules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
The condition of the party had become extremely
desperate, and the war council that
was called, discussed a variety of measures,
equally desperate with their condition, for immediate
relief, until, when the rest had made
their propositions, Carson again showed himself
"the right man in the right place," and
when all besides were hopeless, was the salvation
of his party. He rose in the council and
said:</p>

<p>"Our case <i>is</i> a desperate one, but there is yet
hope. If we stay here, we are all dead men;
our animals cannot last long, and the soldiers
and marines at San Diego do not know of our
coming. But if they receive information of our
position, they would hasten to our rescue.
There is no use in thinking why or how we are
here, but only of our present and speedy escape.
I will attempt to go through the Mexican
lines, and will then go to San Diego, and
send relief from Commodore Stockton."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Beale, of the United States Navy,
at once seconded Carson, and volunteered to
accompany him.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Beale is now widely known for
his valuable services to the country, and, as an
explorer, he has few equals in the world.</p>

<p>The writer is informed that he is now deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
interested in a wagon road across the country
by the route he had just crossed, at the time
of which we write. His life has been full of
strange adventures, since he left the service of
the seas.</p>

<p>Gen. Kearney immediately accepted the proposal
of Carson and Lieutenant Beale, as his
only hope, and they started at once, as soon as
the cover of darkness was hung around them.
Their mission was to be one of success or of
death to themselves, and the whole force. Carson
was familiar with the custom of the Mexicans,
as well as the Indians, of putting their
ear to the ground to detect any sound, and
knew, therefore, the necessity of avoiding the
slightest noise. As this was not possible,
wearing their shoes, they removed them, and
putting them under their belts, crept on over
the bushes and rocks, with the greatest caution
and silence.</p>

<p>They discovered that the Mexicans had three
rows of sentinels, whose beats extended past
each other, embracing the hill where Kearney
and his command were held in siege. They
were, doubtless, satisfied that they could not
be eluded. But our messengers crept on, often
so near a sentinel as to see his figure and
equipment in the darkness; and once, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
within a few yards of them, one of the sentinels
had dismounted and lighted his cigarette
with his flint and steel. Kit Carson seeing
this, as he lay flat on the ground, had put his
foot back and touched Lieutenant Beale, a signal
to be still as he was doing. The minutes
the Mexican was occupied in this way, seemed
hours to our heroes, who expected they were
discovered; and Carson affirms that they were
so still he could hear Lieutenant Beale's heart
pulsate, and in the agony of the time he lived
a year. But the Mexican finally mounted his
horse, and rode off in a contrary direction, as
if he were guided by Providence, to give safety
to these courageous adventurers. For full two
miles Kit Carson and Lieutenant Beale thus
worked their way along, upon their hands and
knees, turning their eyes in every direction to
detect any thing which might lead to their discovery,
and having past the last sentinel, and
left the lines sufficiently behind them, they felt
an immeasurable relief in once more gaining
their feet.</p>

<p>But their shoes were gone, and in the excitement
of the journey, neither of them had
thought of their shoes since they first put them
in their belts; but they could speak again, and
congratulate each other that the imminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
danger was past, and thank heaven that they
had been aided thus far. But there were
still abundant difficulties, as their path was
rough with bushes, from the necessity of
avoiding the well-trodden trail lest they be
detected; and the prickly pear covered the
ground, and its thorns penetrated their feet at
every step; and their road was lengthened by
going around out of the direct path, though
the latter would have shortened their journey
many a weary mile. All the day following
they pursued their journey, and on still,
without cessation, into the night following, for
they could not stop until assured that relief
was to be furnished to their anxious and perilous
conditioned fellow soldiers.</p>

<p>Carson had pursued so straight a course, and
aimed so correctly for his mark, that they entered
the town by the most direct passage, and
answering "friends" to the challenge of the
sentinel, it was known from whence they came,
and they were at once conducted to Commodore
Stockton, to whom they related the errand
on which they had come, and the further particulars
we have described.</p>

<p>Commodore Stockton immediately detailed a
force of nearly two hundred men, and with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
usual promptness, ordered them to seek their
besieged countrymen by forced marches.</p>

<p>They took with them a piece of ordnance,
which the men were obliged to draw themselves,
as there were in readiness no animals
to be had. Carson did not return with them,
as his feet were in a terrible condition, and he
needed to rest or he might lose them, but he
described the position of General Kearney so
accurately, that the party to relieve him would
find him with no difficulty; and yet, if the
Commodore had expressed the wish, he would
have undertaken to conduct the relief party
upon its march.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Beale was partially deranged for
several days, from the effects of this severe
service, and was sent on board the frigate lying
in port for medical attendance; but he did not
fully recover his former physical health for
more than two years; but he never spoke regretfully
of an undertaking, which was not excelled
by any feat performed in the Mexican
war.</p>

<p>The reinforcement reached General Kearney
without a collision with the Mexicans, and very
soon all marched to San Diego, where the
wounded soldiers received medical attendance.</p>

<p>We have spoken of the superiority of character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of the California Mexicans over that of
the inhabitants of the other Mexican States.
The officials appointed at the Mexican capital
for this State, were treated deferentially or
cavalierly, as they consulted or disregarded the
wishes of the people, and often it happened
that a Governor-General of California was put
on board a ship at Monterey, and directed to
betake himself back to those who sent him.</p>

<p>California was so remote from the headquarters
of the general government, that these
things were done with impunity, for it would
have been difficult to send a force into the State
that could subdue it, with its scattered population,
and if laws obnoxious to them were enacted,
and they violated them, or expelled an
official who proposed their enforcement, it was
quietly overlooked. Managing their own affairs
in this way, a spirit of independence and bold
daring had been cultivated, especially since
the time when our story of California life commenced
in Carson's first visit to that State, nor
had the intercourse with Americans hitherto
lessened these feelings, for the California Mexicans
admired the Americans, as they called
them, and cultivated good fellowship with them
generally; so that we see when the Bear Flag
and Independence of the State became the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
order under Fremont and his party, many of
its leading citizens came at once into the arrangement,
or were parties in it at the first.</p>

<p>Had the conquest and government of the
country been conducted wholly by Fremont, it
would have exhibited very little expenditure
of life, for conciliation and the cultivation of
kindly feeling was the policy he pursued; indeed,
with Carson as prime counselor, whose
wife at home in Taos owned kindred with this
people as one of the same race, how could it
have been otherwise! though as Americans and
citizens of the United States, in whose employ
they acted, first allegiance was ever cheerfully
accorded to their country, by Carson equally
with Fremont, as the history of California most
fully proves.</p>

<p>The United States forces at San Diego were
not in condition to again take the field, until a
number of weeks had elapsed, when a command
of six hundred had been organized for the purpose
of again capturing Los Angelos, where
the Mexican forces were concentrated; and
General Kearney and Commodore Stockton
were united in conducting it, and in two days
arrived within fifteen miles of the town, near
where the Mexican army, to the number of
seven hundred, had established themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
strongly upon a hill beside their camp, and
between whom and the Americans flowed a
stream of water.</p>

<p>General Kearney ordered two pieces of artillery
planted where they would rake the position
of the Mexicans, which soon forced them
to break up their camp, when Gen. Kearney
and Commodore Stockton immediately marched
into the town, but only to find it destitute of
any military control, as the Mexican army had
gone northward to meet Col. Fremont, who had
left Monterey with a force of four hundred
Americans, to come to Los Angelos.</p>

<p>The Mexicans found Col. Fremont, and laid
down their arms to him, probably preferring to
give him the honor of the victory rather than
Gen. Kearney, though if this was or was not the
motive, history now sayeth not. Col. Fremont
continued his march and came to Los Angelos,
and as the fighting for the present certainly
was over, he and his men rested here for the
winter, where Carson, who had been rendering
all the aid in his power to Gen. Kearney, now
gladly joined his old commander.</p>

<p>The position of the American forces, had the
camps been harmonious, was as comfortable
and conducive to happiness during the winter
as it was possible for it to be, and the Mexican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
citizens of Los Angelos had been so conciliated,
the time might have passed pleasantly. But,
as we have intimated, Gen. Kearney had a
general contempt for the Mexicans, and his
position in the camp forbade those pleasant
civilities which had commenced in San Diego
before his arrival, and would have been prosecuted
in Los Angelos, to the advantage of all
concerned; for, as many of the men in Fremont's
camp were old residents of the country,
and known and respected by the Mexican
citizens, with whom some of them had contracted
intimate social relations, it is not
wonderful that the Mexican officers and soldiers
chose to lay down their arms to him
and his command. Fremont had beside, at
the instigation of Carson as well as of his own
inclination, taken every reasonable opportunity
to gratify their love of social life, by joining in
their assemblies as opportunity offered; and
for this, as well as his magnanimous courage,
we can appreciate their choice in giving him
the palm of victory.</p>

<p>Events transpire rapidly when a country is
in a state of revolution. Early in March of
'46 the little party of explorers received the
"first hostile message" from General Castro&mdash;the
<i>Commandant</i> General of California&mdash;which,
though really a declaration of war, upon a
party sent out by the United States Government
on a purely scientific expedition, had
been received and acted upon by Fremont with
moderation, and actual war had not been declared
until July, when Sonoma was taken, and
the flag of Independence hoisted on the fourth
of that month, and Fremont elected Governor
of California.</p>

<p>While hearing indefinitely of these events,
Commodore Sloat, who, with the vessels belonging
to his command, was lying at Monterey,
had hoisted the flag of the United
States over that city, anticipating any command
to do so on the part of his government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
and anticipating also the action of the commander
of the British ship of war, sent for a
similar purpose, which arrived at Monterey
on the 19th of July, under the command of
Sir George Seymour; one of whose officers, in
a book published by him after his return to
England, describes the entrance of Fremont
and his party into Monterey as follows:</p>

<p>"During our stay in Monterey," says Mr.
Walpole, "Captain Fremont and his party arrived.
They naturally excited curiosity. Here
were true trappers, the class that produced the
heroes of Fennimore Cooper's best works.
These men had passed years in the wilds,
living upon their own resources; they were a
curious set. A vast cloud of dust appeared
first, and thence in long file emerged this
wildest wild party. Fremont rode ahead, a
spare, active-looking man, with such an eye!
He was dressed in a blouse and leggings, and
wore a felt hat. After him came five Delaware
Indians, who were his body-guard, and
have been with him through all his wanderings;
they had charge of two baggage horses.
The rest, many of them blacker than the Indians,
rode two and two, the rifle held by one
hand across the pommel of the saddle. Thirty-nine
of them are his regular men, the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
are loafers picked up lately; his original men
are principally backwoodsmen, from the State
of Tennessee and the banks of the upper
waters of the Missouri. He has one or two
with him who enjoy a high reputation in the
prairies. Kit Carson is as well known there
as 'the Duke' is in Europe. The dress of
these men was principally a long loose coat of
deer skin, tied with thongs in front; trowsers
of the same, of their own manufacture, which,
when wet through, they take off, scrape well
inside with a knife, and put on as soon as dry;
the saddles were of various fashions, though
these and a large drove of horses, and a brass
field-gun, were things they had picked up
about California. They are allowed no liquor,
tea and sugar only; this, no doubt, has much
to do with their good conduct; and the discipline,
too, is very strict. They were marched
up to an open space on the hills near the town,
under some large fires, and there took up their
quarters, in messes of six or seven, in the open
air. The Indians lay beside their leader. One
man, a doctor, six feet six high, was an odd-looking
fellow. May I never come under his
hands!"</p>

<p>Commodore Stockton had arrived the same
day with Fremont and Carson and their command,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
and under him Fremont had been appointed
General in Chief of the California
forces, with Carson for his first Lieutenant;
Stockton assuming the civil office of Governor
of the country. This had been deemed a
measure of necessity, from the fact that the
California Mexicans had not yet learned, from
the Mexican authorities, the actual declaration
of war between the United States and Mexico;
and therefore looked upon the operations of
the Americans as the acts of adventurers for
their own aggrandizement; and yet, with all
the intensity of feeling such ideas aroused,
Fremont and Carson had won their admiration
and their hearts, by the rapidity of their
movements, their sudden and effective blows,
and the effort by dispatch to avoid all cruelty
and bloodshed as far as possible.</p>

<p>In this way had San Diego, San Pedro, Los
Angelos, Santa Barbara, and the whole country,
as the Mexican authorities declared, come
into the possession of Commodore Stockton
and General Fremont, as a conquered territory,
taken in behalf of the United States; and the
whole work been completed in about sixty days
from the time the first blow was struck; and
when all was accomplished, and the conquest
complete, Carson started upon his errand to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
communicate the intelligence to the general
government at Washington; with the knowledge
that all the leading citizens of California,
native as well as the American settlers, were
friendly to Fremont, and on his account to
Commodore Stockton.</p>

<p>During the three months of Carson's absence,
events had transpired that made it necessary
to do this work over again, resulting in a
measure from the indiscretions of American
officers, which induced insurrection on the part
of the Mexicans. The arrival of General
Kearney with United States troops still further
excited them, and produced results which were
everything but pleasant to Fremont and Commodore
Stockton, the details of which we forbear
to give, simply saying that Carson's regard
for Fremont showed itself by his return
to his service, and doing all that he could to
forward his interests, and in his often attending
him in his excursions. Fremont's command
was an independent battalion; and concerning
the last and final contest, General
Kearney thus wrote to the War Department:</p>

<p>"This morning, Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont,
of the regiment of mounted riflemen,
reached here with four hundred volunteers
from the Sacramento; the enemy capitulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
with him yesterday, near San Fernando, agreeing
to lay down their arms; and we have now
the prospect of having peace and quietness in
this country, which I hope may not be interrupted
again."</p>

<p>It was during Carson's absence, en route for
Washington, that Fremont accomplished the
most extraordinary feat of physical energy and
endurance ever recorded. We find it in the
"National Intelligencer," of November 22, 1847,
and quote it entire, as illustrating not only the
physical powers of human endurance produced
by practice and culture, but the wonderful
sagacity and enduring qualities of the California
horses:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0 larger smcap">"The Extraordinary Ride of Lieut. Col. Fremont,
his friend Don Jesus Pico, and his Servant, Jacob
Dodson, from Los Angelos to Monterey and Back
in March, 1847.</p></blockquote>

<p>"This extraordinary ride of 800 miles in
eight days, including all stoppages and near
two days' detention&mdash;a whole day and a night
at Monterey, and nearly two half days at San
Luis Obispo&mdash;having been brought into evidence
before the Army Court Martial now in
session in this city, and great desire being expressed
by some friends to know how the ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
was made, I herewith send you the particulars,
that you may publish them, if you please, in
the National Intelligencer, as an incident connected
with the times and affairs under review
in the trial, of which you give so full a report.
The circumstances were first got from Jacob,
afterwards revised by Col. Fremont, and I
drew them up from his statement.</p>

<p>"The publication will show, besides the
horsemanship of the riders, the power of the
California horse, especially as one of the horses
was subjected, in the course of the ride, to an
extraordinary trial, in order to exhibit the
capacity of his race. Of course this statement
will make no allusion to the objects of the
journey, but be confined strictly to its performance.</p>

<p>"It was at daybreak on the morning of the
22d of March, that the party set out from La
Ciudad de los Angelos (the city of the Angels)
in the southern part of Upper California, to
proceed, in the shortest time, to Monterey on
the Pacific coast, distant full four hundred
miles. The way is over a mountainous country,
much of it uninhabited, with no other road
than a trace, and many defiles to pass, particularly
the maritime defile of <i>el Rincon</i> or Punto
Gordo, fifteen miles in extent, made by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
jutting of a precipitous mountain into the sea,
and which can only be passed when the tide is
out and the sea calm, and then in many places
through the waves. The towns of Santa Barbara
and San Luis Obispo, and occasional
ranches, are the principal inhabited places on
the route. Each of the party had three horses,
nine in all, to take their turns under the saddle.
The six loose horses ran ahead, without bridle
or halter, and required some attention to keep
to the track. When wanted for a change, say
at the distance of twenty miles, they were
caught by the <i>lasso</i>, thrown either by Don Jesus
or the servant Jacob, who, though born in
Washington, in his long expeditions with Col.
Fremont, had become as expert as a Mexican
with the lasso, as sure as the mountaineer with
the rifle, equal to either on horse or foot, and
always a lad of courage and fidelity.</p>

<p>"None of the horses were shod, that being a
practice unknown to the Californians. The
most usual gait was a sweeping gallop. The
first day they ran one hundred and twenty-five
miles, passing the San Fernando mountain, the
defile of the Rincon, several other mountains,
and slept at the hospitable ranche of Don
Thomas Robberis, beyond the town of Santa
Barbara. The only fatigue complained of in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
this day's ride, was in Jacob's right arm, made
tired by throwing the lasso, and using it as a
whip to keep the loose horses to the track.</p>

<p>"The next day they made another one hundred
and twenty-five miles, passing the formidable
mountain of Santa Barbara, and counting
upon it the skeletons of some fifty horses, part
of near double that number which perished in
the crossing of that terrible mountain by the
California battalion, on Christmas day, 1846,
amidst a raging tempest, and a deluge of rain
and cold more killing than that of the Sierra
Nevada&mdash;the day of severest suffering, say
Fremont and his men, that they have ever
passed. At sunset, the party stopped to sup
with the friendly Capt. Dana, and at nine at
night San Luis Obispo was reached, the home
of Don Jesus, and where an affecting reception
awaited Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont, in consequence
of an incident which occurred there
that history will one day record; and he was
detained till 10 o'clock in the morning receiving
the visits of the inhabitants, (mothers and
children included,) taking a breakfast of honor,
and waiting for a relief of fresh horses to be
brought in from the surrounding country.
Here the nine horses from Los Angelos were
left, and eight others taken in their place, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
a Spanish boy added to the party to assist in
managing the loose horses.</p>

<p>"Proceeding at the usual gait till eight
at night, and having made some seventy miles,
Don Jesus, who had spent the night before
with his family and friends, and probably with
but little sleep, became fatigued, and proposed
a halt for a few hours. It was in the valley of
the Salinas (salt river called <i>Buenaventura</i> in
the old maps,) and the haunt of marauding
Indians. For safety during their repose, the
party turned off the trace, issued through a
<i>cañon</i> into a thick wood, and laid down, the
horses being put to grass at a short distance,
with the Spanish boy in the saddle to watch.
Sleep, when commenced, was too sweet to be
easily given up, and it was half way between
midnight and day, when the sleepers were
aroused by an <i>estampedo</i> among the horses, and
the calls of the boy. The cause of the alarm
was soon found, not Indians, but white bears&mdash;this
valley being their great resort, and the
place where Col. Fremont and thirty-five of
his men encountered some hundred of them
the summer before, killing thirty upon the
ground.</p>

<p>"The character of these bears is well known,
and the bravest hunters do not like to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
them without the advantage of numbers. On
discovering the enemy, Col. Fremont felt for
his pistols, but Don Jesus desired him to lie
still, saying that 'people could scare bears;'
and immediately hallooed at them in Spanish,
and they went off. Sleep went off also; and
the recovery of the horses frightened by the
bears, building a rousing fire, making a breakfast
from the hospitable supplies of San Luis
Obispo, occupied the party till daybreak, when
the journey was resumed. Eighty miles, and
the afternoon brought the party to Monterey.</p>

<p>"The next day, in the afternoon, the party
set out on their return, and the two horses rode
by Col. Fremont from San Luis Obispo, being
a present to him from Don Jesus, he (Don
Jesus) desired to make an experiment of what
one of them could do. They were brothers,
one a grass younger than the other, both of the
same color, (cinnamon,) and hence called <i>el
cañalo</i>, or <i>los cañalos</i>, (the cinnamon or the cinnamons.)
The elder was to be taken for the
trial; and the journey commenced upon him
at leaving Monterey, the afternoon well advanced.
Thirty miles under the saddle done
that evening, and the party stopped for the
night. In the morning, the elder cañalo was
again under the saddle for Col. Fremont, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
for ninety miles he carried him without a
change, and without apparent fatigue. It was
still thirty miles to San Luis Obispo, where
the night was to be passed, and Don Jesus insisted
that cañalo could do it, and so said the
horse by his looks and action. But Col. Fremont
would not put him to the trial, and,
shifting the saddle to the younger brother, the
elder was turned loose to run the remaining
thirty miles without a rider. He did so, immediately
taking the lead and keeping it all
the way, and entering San Luis in a sweeping
gallop, nostrils distended, snuffing the air, and
neighing with exultation at his return to his
native pastures; his younger brother all the
time at the head of the horses under the
saddle, bearing on his bit, and held in by his
rider. The whole eight horses made their one
hundred and twenty miles each that day, (after
thirty the evening before,) the elder cinnamon
making ninety of his under the saddle that
day, besides thirty under the saddle the
evening before; nor was there the least doubt
that he would have done the whole distance in
the same time if he had continued under the
saddle.</p>

<p>"After a hospitable detention of another
half a day at San Luis Obispo, the party set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
out for Los Angelos, on the same nine horses
which they had rode from that place, and
made the ride back in about the same time
they had made it up, namely, at the rate of 125
miles a day.</p>

<p>"On this ride, the grass on the road was the
food for the horses. At Monterey they had
barley; but these horses, meaning those
<i>trained and domesticated</i>, as the cañalos were,
eat almost anything of vegetable food, or even
drink, that their master uses, by whom they
are petted and caressed, and rarely sold.
Bread, fruit, sugar, coffee, and even wine, (like
the Persian horses,) they take from the hand
of their master, and obey with like docility his
slightest intimation. A tap of the whip on the
saddle, springs them into action; the check of
a thread rein (on the Spanish bit) would stop
them: and stopping short at speed they do not
jostle the rider or throw him forward. They
leap on anything&mdash;man, beast, or weapon, on
which their master directs them. But this
description, so far as conduct and behavior are
concerned, of course only applies to the trained
and domesticated horse."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>

<p>During the autumn of 1846, Fremont had
had no time to visit his Mariposa purchase;
but in the winter, while at Los Angelos, inviting
Carson and Godey and two of his Delaware
Indians, and his constant attendant Dobson,
to take a tramp with him for hunting, in
the time of sunny skies in February, he extended
his hunt thither, and accomplished the
discovery that he had a well-wooded and well-watered&mdash;for
California well watered&mdash;tract
of land, of exceeding beauty, clothed, as it was
at this season, with a countless variety of flowering
plants, these being the grasses of the
country, and seemingly well adapted for tillage,
certainly an excellent spot for an immense
cattle ranche. They killed deer and antelope
and smaller game, and with the lasso captured
a score of wild horses from a drove of hundreds
that fled at their approach; returning to Los<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Angelos within a week from the time of their
departure, laden with the spoils of the chase.</p>

<p>Nor could these busy men refuse the kindly
hospitalities tendered them by the old and
wealthy natives of Los Angelos. We have
described their style of life as Carson had witnessed
it in 1828; and now at a ball given by
Don Pio Pico&mdash;for the <i>fandango</i> of the Mexican
is a part of his life, and with all his reverses
of fortune it must come in for its place&mdash;Carson
and Fremont are of course guests,
and Lieutenant Gillespie, and some other of
the American officers. As the company was a
mixed one, we will not attempt a description,
but quote from Bayard Taylor's California, a
scene of a similar kind at the close of the Constitutional
Convention, about two years later,
when, with the discovery of gold, California
had a population sufficient to demand a State
government, and made one for herself, and
prepared to knock for admission into the Union
of States. In this Convention were the old
fathers of California, American army officers,
and some more recent arrivals; and well was
it for California that the steps for the organization
of her State government were taken so
early, when the fact of Mexicans and natives
having a claim was not ignored, as it might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
have been at a later date by the reckless adventurers
who thronged the golden shore.</p>

<p>But it is only the ball at the close of the
Convention we propose to describe, at which
Col. Fremont and David C. Broderick were
present, as members of the Convention.</p>

<p>"The morning Convention was short and adjourned
early yesterday, on account of a ball
given by the Convention to the citizens of Monterey.
The members, by a contribution of $25
each, raised the sum of $1,100 to provide for
the entertainment, which was got up in return
for that given by the citizens about four
weeks since.</p>

<p>"The Hall was cleared of the forms and
tables, and decorated with young pines from
the forest. At each end were the American
colors tastefully disposed across the boughs.
Then chandeliers, neither of bronze or cut-glass,
but neat and brilliant withal, poured
their light upon the festivities. At eight
o'clock&mdash;the fashionable hour in Monterey&mdash;the
guests began to assemble, and in an hour
afterward the Hall was crowded with nearly
all the Californian and American residents.
There were sixty ladies present, and an equal
number of gentlemen, in addition to the members
of the Convention. The dark-eyed daughters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
of Monterey, Los Angelos, and Santa
Barbara mingled in pleasing contrast with the
fairer bloom of the trans-Nevadian belles.
The variety of feature and complexion was
fully equaled by the variety of dress. In the
whirl of the waltz, a plain, dark, nun-like robe
would be followed by one of pink satin and
gauze; next, perhaps, a bodice of scarlet velvet,
with gold buttons, and then a rich figured brocade,
such as one sees on the stately dames of
Titian.</p>

<p>"The dresses of the gentlemen showed considerable
variety, but were much less picturesque.
A complete ball-dress was a happiness
attained only by a fortunate few, many
appearing in borrowed robes.</p>

<p>"The appearance of the company, nevertheless,
was genteel and respectable; and perhaps
the genial, unrestrained social spirit, that possessed
all present, would have been less, had
there been more uniformity of costume. Gen.
Riley was there in full uniform, with the yellow
sash he wore at Contreras; Mayors Canby,
Hill, and Smith, Captains Burton, and Kane,
and the other officers stationed at Monterey, accompanying
him. In one group might be seen
Capt. Sutter's soldierly mustache and blue eye,
in another the erect figure and quiet, dignified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
bearing of Gen. Vallejo; Don Peblo de la
Guerra, with his handsome, aristocratic features,
was the floor manager, and gallantly
discharged his office. Conspicuous among the
members were Don Miguel de Rodrazena, and
Jacinto Rodriguez, both polished gentlemen
and deservedly popular. Dominguez, the Indian
member, took no part in the dance, but
evidently enjoyed the scene as much as any
one present. The most interesting figure to
me, was that of Padre Remisez, who, in his
clerical cassock, looked on until a late hour.
If the strongest advocate of priestly gravity
and decorum had been present, he could not
have found in his heart to grudge the good old
padre the pleasure that beamed from his
honest countenance.</p>

<p>"The band consisted of two violins and two
guitars, whose music made up in spirit what it
lacked in skill. They played, as it seemed to
me, but three pieces alternately, for waltz, contra-dance,
and quadrille. The latter dance
was evidently an unfamiliar one, for once or
twice the music ceased in the middle of the
figure. The etiquette of the dance was marked
by that grave, stately courtesy, which has been
handed down from the old Spanish times. The
gentlemen invariably gave the ladies their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
hand to lead them to their places on the floor;
in the pauses of the dance both parties stood
motionless side by side, and at the conclusion
the lady was gravely led back to her seat.</p>

<p>"At twelve o'clock supper was announced.
The Court room in the lower story had been
fitted up for the purpose, and as it was not
large enough to admit all the guests, the ladies
were first conducted thither, and waited upon
by a select committee. The refreshments consisted
of turkey, roast-pig, beef, tongue, and
<i>patés</i>, with wines and liquors of various sorts,
and coffee. A large supply had been provided
but after everybody was served, there was not
much remaining. The ladies began to leave
about two o'clock, but an hour later the dance
was still going on with spirit."</p>

<p>The dance at the home of Pico, was after
the same fashion&mdash;and similar to those we have
mentioned as the constant amusement of the
people at Taos, where Carson resided, and in
all the Mexican cities.</p>

<p>But Carson was too valuable an aid to be
long allowed to be idle. In March, 1847, he
was ordered to be the bearer of important dispatches
to the War Department at Washington,
and Lieutenant Beale was directed to accompany
him with dispatches for the Department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
of the Navy. The latter was still so
much an invalid as to require Carson to lift
him on and off his horse for the first twenty
days of the journey, but Carson's genial spirits
and kindly care, with the healthful exercise of
horsemanship, recovered him rapidly; and the
country was so well known to Carson, that they
avoided collisions with the Indians by eluding
their haunts; except once upon the Gila, when
they were attacked in the night, and a shower
of arrows sent among them as they lay in
camp, from which his men had escaped, being
injured by holding their pack-saddles before
them. They stopped briefly at Taos, and pursued
their journey so rapidly that the two
thousand five hundred miles on horseback,
and the fifteen hundred by railroad, were accomplished
in less than three months.</p>

<p>The incidents of such a journey had become
every-day scenes to Carson, so that their narration
would seem to him a waste of words on
the part of his biographer. And yet the emotions
with which he witnessed, for the first
time, the monument of advancing civilization
in the Eastern cities, and the zest with which
he enjoyed the social comforts of the hospitality
afforded him at the homes of Lieutenant Beale
and Col. Benton, can be better imagined than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
described. He had taken but a small supply
of provisions from Los Angelos, lest it should
be cumbersome to him, and as the road lay
often through a country destitute of game, there
had been fasting on the way, sometimes days
together; but his party, which he had selected,
making their ability to endure such an enterprise
a leading quality of commendation to
him, bore all without a murmur; stimulated
by the one impulse, of reaching their homes and
friends, while Carson cared to secure the approbation
of those whom he served, and the consciousness
of having been an honor to his
country.</p>

<p>Col. Benton met him at St. Louis, and reaching
Washington, Mrs. Fremont was at the
depot to take him to her's and her father's
home. She waited for no introduction, but at
once approached him, calling him by name, and
telling him she should have known him from
her husband's description. After a brief tarry
in Washington, a lion himself and introduced
to all the lions, he departed with Lieutenant
Beale for St. Louis, but business detained the
latter who went later by sea; while Carson,
whom President Polk had made a Lieutenant
in the army, with fifty troops under his command
to take through the Camanche country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
again commenced his journey across the prairies,
having a battle with these Indians as was
expected, for they were at war with the whites.</p>

<p>This did not occur, however, until near the
Rocky Mountains, near the place called "The
Point of Rocks," on the Santa Fe trail, which
place is regarded as one of the most dangerous
in the New Mexican country, because affording
shelter for ambush at a place where the travel
has to pass a spur of rocky hills, at whose base
is found the water and camp ground travelers
seek, and where unwritten history counts many
a battle.</p>

<p>Arriving here, Carson found a company of
United States volunteers, and went into camp
near them. Early in the morning the animals
of the volunteer company were captured by a
band of Indians, while the men were taking
them to a spot of fresh pasture. The herders
were without arms, and in the confusion the
cattle came into Carson's camp, who, with his
men, were ready with their rifles, and recaptured
the cattle from the Indians, but the
horses of the picketing party were successfully
stampeded.</p>

<p>Several of the thieves had been mortally
wounded, as the signs after their departure
showed, but the Indian custom of tying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
wounded upon their horses, prevented taking
the Indian's trophy of victory, the scalp, and
the object of the Indians in their assaults.
The success of the Arab-like Camanches is well
illustrated by this skirmish, giving best assurance
that Carson, who was never surprised in
this whole journey, possessed that element of
caution so requisite in a commander in such a
country.</p>

<p>Of the two soldiers whose turn it had been
to stand guard this morning, it was found that
one was sleeping when the alarm was given,
and when it was reported to Carson, he at once
administered the Chinook method of punishment&mdash;the
dress of a squaw&mdash;for that day, and
resuming his journey, arrived safely in Santa
Fe, where he left the soldiers, and hired sixteen
men of his own choosing, to make with him the
remainder of the journey, as he had been ordered
at Fort Leavenworth. To his great joy,
his family were here to meet him, as he had
requested. Upon Virgin River, he had to command
the obedience of Indians who came into
his camp and left it tardily, by firing upon
them, which required some nerve and experience
in a leader of so small a party, while the
Indians numbered three hundred warriors.
They arrived at Los Angelos without further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
incident than the killing and eating of two
mules, to eke out their scanty subsistence, in
the destitution of game and time to hunt it;
whence Carson proceeded to Monterey, to deliver
his dispatches at headquarters, and returned
to the duty assigned him as an acting
Lieutenant in the United States Army, in the
company of dragoons under Capt. Smith, allowing
himself no time to recruit; and soon he was
sent with a command of twenty-five dragoons,
to the Tejon Pass, to examine the papers and
cargoes of Indians passing this point, the route
which most of the Indian depredators took in
passing in and out of California; and here he
did much good service during the winter.</p>

<p>In the spring he again went overland to
Washington with dispatches, meeting no serious
difficulty till he came to the Grand River, where
in the time of spring flood he was obliged to
construct a raft, and the second load over was
swamped, the men barely saving their lives,
which rendered his party destitute of comforts
in their onward journey, but arriving at Taos
he stopped with his family, and at his own
home gave his men a few days to recruit, and
himself the luxury of intercourse with his
family and friends, which no one enjoys more
than Christopher Carson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
They had encountered several hundred Indians
of the Apaches and Utahs, whom Carson
told he had nothing to give, and upon whom
the appearance of his men gave assurance they
would make little by attacking. At Santa Fe,
Carson learned that his appointment as Lieutenant
by the President had not been confirmed
by the Senate, and his friends advised him not
to carry the dispatches any further; but Carson
was not to be deterred from doing his duty because
the honor he deserved was not accorded
to him, saying that "as he had been selected
for an important trust, he should do his best to
fulfill it, if it cost him his life;" and he proceeded
to Washington, feeling that if ill-usage had
reached him in connection with Fremont, to
whom he had been of so much service, it was
no more than he might have expected; as,
for many months past, political considerations
and rivalries had been seen by him to govern
the actions of certain men, instead of a care for
the best interests of the country. He had seen
men in command of troops in the prairies who
had the least possible knowledge of the country,
and especially of Indian warfare. He would
have advised that frontier men be chosen for
such appointments, rather than those simply
educated in the schools and entirely unaccustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
to endure privations, but if others neglected
the wiser course, that was no reason
why he should not do his duty.</p>

<p>Learning that the Camanches were upon the
Santa Fe road, several hundred strong, he reduced
his escort to ten choice mountain men,
and determined upon making a trail of his own
returned to Taos, and struck over to the head-waters
of the Platte, and past Fort Kearney to
Leavenworth, where he left his escort and proceeded
alone to Washington, and delivering his
dispatches as directed, returned immediately to
Leavenworth, and thence to Taos, where he arrived
in October; and was again at home and
free from the burdens and responsibilities of
public life, with the settled purpose of making
a protracted stay, and providing himself with a
permanent home.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no tribe of Indians besides
the Seminoles in Florida, that have given the
United States more trouble than the Apaches,
in the time that we have held the claim of their
country; and the best proof of their bravery
may be found in the fact that the warriors
nearly all die in battle. Living in a country
as healthy as any in the world, and constantly
occupied in hunting buffalo, or Mexicans and
whites, with whom they are at war, they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
exceedingly regardful of their national honor,
and as their mountain retreats are almost inaccessible,
they have the advantage of regular
troops, and almost of old mountaineers, only
as the latter can equal them in numbers.</p>

<p>Col. Beale was occupying this department at
the time of which we write, and engaged in an
effort to chastise the Apaches under <i>Clico Velasquez</i>,
their exceedingly blood-thirsty and
cruel chief, whose habit was to adorn his dress
with the finger bones of the victims he had
slaughtered. Col. Beale took charge of the
command himself, and employed Carson as his
guide. They crossed snow mountains to search
for the Indians, and returning came upon a
village, which they attacked, and captured a
large amount of goods and two of the chiefs of
the tribe, with whom Col. Beale had a long
talk, and then dismissed to return to their
tribe, hoping thus to convince them of the magnanimity
of the United States Government,
when the command returned to Taos to recruit
his troops.</p>

<p>Meantime Carson entertained, at his own
home in Taos, Fremont and his party of suffering
explorers, who were making a winter survey
of a pass for a road to California, and by taking
a difficult mountain pass, had lost all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
mules and several of their party. Science is
not all that is needed for such undertakings,
and as labor and learning should act in co-partnership,
to be most effective, so theoretic
and practical skill should be associated in any
effort of difficulty, as this trip of Col. Fremont,
without an experienced mountaineer for a
guide, proved to him and his men, some of
whom had fed upon the others who had
starved.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>

<p>In the last chapter, we left Fremont in the
hospitable mansion of his old and tried friend
Carson, after one of the most extraordinary
journeys ever performed by any man who survived
to tell its horrors; and as the names of
Carson and Fremont are inseparably cemented
in history, as in friendship, and as the former
had often endured sufferings almost as great
as those of his old commander and friend, we
shall be pardoned if we allude to this journey
at some length. There is no earthly doubt
that had Carson been the guide, many valuable
lives of noble, glorious men might have been
spared, and sufferings on the part of those
who survived this disastrous expedition, almost
too horrible for belief, avoided.</p>

<p>Col. Fremont, in a letter written to his wife
from Taos, the day after his arrival there in a
famishing condition, and having lost one full
third of his party by absolute starvation and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
freezing, mentions that at Pueblo he engaged
as a guide, an old trapper of twenty-five years,
experience, named "Bill Williams," and he
frankly admits that the "error of his journey
was committed in engaging this man."</p>

<p>In narrating some of the incidents of this
terribly disastrous journey, we shall use, of
course, the language of those best qualified to
depict its horrors, <i>i. e.</i>, Col. Fremont, and
Mr. Carvalho, a gentleman of Baltimore, who
accompanied the expedition as daguerreotypist
and artist.</p>

<p>Col. Fremont, in his letter to his wife, treats
of the subject generally, but when we quote
from the narrative of Mr. Carvalho, we think
our readers will admit that such a record of
human suffering, and human endurance, added
to such an exhibition of moral and physical
courage, has never been paralleled.</p>

<p>Col. Fremont writes, (speaking first of Williams
the guide,)</p>

<p>"He proved never to have in the least
known, or entirely to have forgotten, the whole
region of country through which we were to
pass. We occupied more than half a month
in making the journey of a few days, blundering
a tortuous way through deep snow which
already began to choke up the passes, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
which we were obliged to waste time in searching.
About the 11th December we found
ourselves at the North of the Del Norte Cañon,
where that river issues from the St. John's
Mountain, one of the highest, most rugged
and impracticable of all the Rocky Mountain
ranges, inaccessible to trappers and hunters
even in the summer time.</p>

<p>"Across the point of this elevated range our
guide conducted us, and having still great confidence
in his knowledge, we pressed onwards
with fatal resolution. Even along the river
bottoms the snow was already belly deep for
the mules, frequently snowing in the valley
and almost constantly in the mountains. The
cold was extraordinary; at the warmest hours
of the day (between one and two) the thermometer
(Fahrenheit) standing in the shade
of only a tree trunk at zero; the day sunshiny,
with a moderate breeze. We pressed
up towards the summit, the snow deepening;
and in four or five days reached the naked
ridges which lie above the timbered country,
and which form the dividing grounds between
the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.</p>

<p>"Along these naked ridges it storms nearly
all winter, and the winds sweep across them
with remorseless fury. On our first attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
to cross we encountered a <i>pouderié</i> (dry snow
driven thick through the air by violent wind,
and in which objects are visible only at a short
distance,) and were driven back, having some
ten or twelve men variously frozen, face, hands,
or feet. The guide became nigh being frozen
to death here, and dead mules were already
lying about the fires. Meantime, it snowed
steadily. The next day we made mauls, and
beating a road or trench through the snow,
crossed the crest in defiance of the <i>pouderié</i>,
and encamped immediately below in the edge
of the timber.</p>

<p>"Westward, the country was buried in deep
snow. It was impossible to advance, and to
turn back was equally impracticable. We
were overtaken by sudden and inevitable ruin,
and it was instantly apparent that we should
lose every animal.</p>

<p>"I determined to recross the mountain more
towards the open country, and haul or pack
the baggage (by men) down to the Del Norte.
With great labor the baggage was transported
across the crest to the head springs of a little
stream leading to the main river. A few days
were sufficient to destroy our fine band of
mules. They generally kept huddled together,
and as they froze, one would be seen to tumble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
down, and the snow would cover him; sometimes
they would break off and rush down
towards the timber until they were stopped by
the deep snow, where they were soon hidden
by the <i>pouderié</i>.</p>

<p>"The courage of the men failed fast; in
fact, I have never seen men so soon discouraged
by misfortune as we were on this occasion;
but, as you know, the party was not constituted
like the former ones. But among those
who deserve to be honorably mentioned, and
who behaved like what they were&mdash;men of the
old exploring party,&mdash;were Godey, King, and
Taplin; and first of all Godey.</p>

<p>"In this situation, I determined to send in a
party to the Spanish settlements of New
Mexico for provisions and mules to transport
our baggage to Taos. With economy, and
after we should leave the mules, we had not
two weeks' provisions in the camp. These
consisted of a store which I had reserved for a
hard day, macaroni and bacon. From among
the volunteers I chose King, Brackenridge,
Creutzfeldt, and the guide Williams; the party
under the command of King. In case of the
least delay at the settlements, he was to send
me an express.</p>

<p>"Day after day passed by, and no news from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
our express party. Snow continued to fall
almost incessantly on the mountain. The
spirits of the camp grew lower. Prone laid
down in the trail and froze to death. In a sunshiny
day, and having with him means to make
a fire, he threw his blankets down in the trail
and laid there till he froze to death. After
sixteen days had elapsed from King's departure,
I became so uneasy at the delay that I
decided to wait no longer. I was aware that
our troops had been engaged in hostilities with
the Spanish Utahs and Apaches, who range in
the North River valley, and became fearful
that they (King's party) had been cut off by
these Indians; I could imagine no other accident.
Leaving the camp employed with the
baggage and in charge of Mr. Vincenthaler, I
started down the river with a small party consisting
of Godey, (with his young nephew,) Mr.
Preuss and Saunders. We carried our arms
and provision for two or three days. In the
camp the messes had provisions for two or
three meals, more or less; and about five
pounds of sugar to each man. Failing to meet
King, my intention was to make the Red River
settlement about twenty-five miles north of
Taos, and send back the speediest relief possible.
My instructions to the camp were, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
if they did not hear from me within a stated
time, they were to follow down the Del Norte.</p>

<p>"About sunset on the sixth day, we discovered
a little smoke, in a grove of timber off
from the river, and thinking perhaps it might
be our express party on its return, we went to
see. This was the twenty-second day since
they had left us, and the sixth since we had
left the camp. We found them&mdash;three of
them&mdash;Creutzfeldt, Brackenridge, and Williams&mdash;the
most miserable objects I have ever
seen. I did not recognize Creutzfeldt's features
when Brackenridge brought him up to me and
mentioned his name. They had been starving.
King had starved to death a few days before.
His remains were some six or eight miles
above, near the river. By aid of the horses,
we carried these three men with us to Red
River settlement, which we reached (Jan. 20,)
on the tenth evening after leaving our camp in
the mountains, having traveled through snow
and on foot one hundred and sixty miles.</p>

<p>"The morning after reaching the Red River
town, Godey and myself rode on to the Rio
Hondo and Taos, in search of animals and
supplies, and on the second evening after that
on which we had reached Red River, Godey
had returned to that place with about thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
animals, provisions, and four Mexicans, with
which he set out for the camp on the following
morning.</p>

<p>"You will remember that I had left the
camp with occupation sufficient to employ
them for three or four days, after which they
were to follow me down the river. Within
that time I had expected the relief from King,
if it was to come at all.</p>

<p>"They remained where I had left them seven
days, and then started down the river. Manuel&mdash;you
will remember Manuel, the Cosumne
Indian&mdash;gave way to a feeling of despair after
they had traveled about two miles, begged
Haler to shoot him, and then turned and made
his way back to the camp; intending to die
there, as he doubtless soon did. They followed
our trail down the river&mdash;twenty-two men they
were in all. About ten miles below the camp,
Wise gave out, threw away his gun and
blanket, and a few hundred yards further fell
over into the snow and died. Two Indian
boys, young men, countrymen of Manuel, were
behind. They rolled up Wise in his blanket,
and buried him in the snow on the river bank.
No more died that day&mdash;none the next. Carver
raved during the night, his imagination wholly
occupied with images of many things which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
fancied himself eating. In the morning, he
wandered off from the party, and probably
soon died. They did not see him again.</p>

<p>"Sorel on this day gave out, and laid down
to die. They built him a fire, and Morin, who
was in a dying condition, and snow-blind, remained.
These two did not probably last till
the next morning. That evening, I think, Hubbard
killed a deer. They traveled on, getting
here and there a grouse, but probably nothing
else, the snow having frightened off the game.
Things were desperate, and brought Haler to
the determination of breaking up the party, in
order to prevent them from living upon each
other. He told them 'that he had done all he
could for them, that they had no other hope
remaining than the expected relief, and that
their best plan was to scatter and make the
best of their way in small parties down the
river. That, for his part, if he was to be eaten,
he would, at all events, be found traveling
when he did die.' They accordingly separated.</p>

<p>"With Mr. Haler continued five others and
the two Indian boys. Rohrer now became
very despondent; Haler encouraged him by
recalling to mind his family, and urged him to
hold out a little longer. On this day he fell
behind, but promised to overtake them at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
evening. Haler, Scott, Hubbard, and Martin
agreed that if any one of them should give
out, the others were not to wait for him to die,
but build a fire for him, and push on. At
night, Kern's mess encamped a few hundred
yards from Haler's, with the intention, according
to Taplin, to remain where they were until
the relief should come, and in the meantime to
live upon those who had died, and upon the
weaker ones as they should die. With the
three Kerns were Cathcart, Andrews, McKie,
Stepperfeldt, and Taplin.</p>

<p>"Ferguson and Beadle had remained together
behind. In the evening, Rohrer came
up and remained with Kern's mess. Mr. Haler
learned afterwards from that mess that Rohrer
and Andrews wandered off the next day and
died. They say they saw their bodies. In the
morning Haler's party continued on. After a
few hours, Hubbard gave out. They built
him a fire, gathered him some wood, and left
him, without, as Haler says, turning their
heads to look at him as they went off. About
two miles further, Scott&mdash;you remember Scott&mdash;who
used to shoot birds for you at the frontier&mdash;gave
out. They did the same for him as
for Hubbard, and continued on. In the afternoon,
the Indian boys went ahead, and before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
nightfall met Godey with the relief. Haler
heard and knew the guns which he fired for
him at night, and starting early in the morning,
soon met him. I hear that they all cried
together like children. Haler turned back
with Godey, and went with him to where they
had left Scott. He was still alive, and was
saved. Hubbard was dead&mdash;still warm. From
Kern's mess they learned the death of Andrews
and Rohrer, and a little above, met
Ferguson, who told them that Beadle had died
the night before."</p>

<p>Such is a portion of the brief, but thrilling
narrative of this extraordinary and disastrous
journey, as detailed in a familiar letter by
Col. Fremont to his wife; but Mr. Carvalho
gives in detail some of the particulars of the
horrors which overtook them, all through the
unfortunate error of engaging as guide, a man
who either knew nothing, or had forgotten all
he had ever known, of the localities which the
party designed and hoped to reach.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>

<p>We quote now from the closing part of Mr.
Carvalho's narrative:</p>

<p>"At last we are drawn to the necessity of
killing our brave horses for food. To-day the
first sacrifice was made. It was with us all a
solemn event, rendered far more solemn however
by the impressive scene which followed.
Col. Fremont came out to us, and after referring
to the dreadful necessities to which his
men had been reduced on a previous expedition,
of eating each other, he begged us to
swear that in no extremity of hunger, would
any of his men lift his hand against, or attempt
to prey upon a comrade; sooner let him
die with them than live upon them. They all
promptly took the oath, and threatened to
shoot the first one that hinted or proposed
such a thing.</p>

<p>"It was a most impressive scene, to witness
twenty-two men on a snowy mountain, with
bare heads, and hands and eyes upraised to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
heaven, uttering the solemn vow, 'So help me
God!'&mdash;and the valley echoed, 'So help me
God!' I never, until that moment, realized
the awful situation in which I was placed. I
remembered the words of the Psalmist, and
felt perfectly assured of my final safety. They
<i>wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way</i>;
they found <i>no city to dwell in</i>. <i>Hungry and
thirsty their soul fainteth within them, and they
cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered
them out of their distresses.</i></p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>"When an animal gave out, he was shot down
by the Indians, who immediately cut his
throat, and saved all the blood in our camp
kettle. This animal was divided into twenty-two-parts.
Two parts for Col. Fremont and
his cook, ten parts for the white camp, and ten
parts for the Indians. Col. Fremont hitherto
messed with his officers; at this time he requested
that they would excuse him, as it gave
him pain, and called to mind the horrible
scenes which had been enacted during his last
expedition&mdash;he could not see his officers obliged
to partake of such disgusting food.</p>

<p>"The rule he adopted was that one animal
should serve for six meals for the whole party.
If one gave out in the meantime, of course it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
was an exception; but otherwise, on no consideration
was an animal to be slaughtered, for
every one that was killed, placed a man on
foot, and limited our chances of escape from
our present situation. If the men chose to eat
up their six meals all in one day, they would
have to go without until the time arrived for
killing another. It frequently happened that
the white camp was without food from twenty-four
to thirty-six hours, while Col. Fremont
and the Delawares always had a meal. The
latter religiously abstained from encroaching
on the portion allotted for another meal, while
many men of our camp, I may say all of them,
not content with their portion, would, to satisfy
the cravings of hunger, surreptitiously purloin
from their pile of meat, at different times,
sundry pieces, thus depriving themselves of
each other's allowance. My own sense of right
was so subdued by the sufferings I endured by
hunger, and walking almost barefooted through
the snow, that while going to guard one night,
I stole a piece of frozen horse liver, ate it raw,
and thought it, at the time, the most delicious
morsel I ever tasted.</p>

<p>"The entrails of the horse were 'well
shaken' (for we had no water to wash them
in) and boiled with snow, producing a highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
flavored soup, which the men considered so
valuable and delicious that they forbade the
cook to skim the pot for fear any portion of it
might be lost. The hide was divided into
equal portions, and with the bones roasted and
burnt to a crisp. This we munched on the
road; but the men not being satisfied with the
division of the meat by the cook, made him
turn his back, while another took up each
share separately, and enquired who should
have it. When the snows admitted it, we collected
the thick leaves of a species of cactus
which we also put in the fire to burn off the
prickles, and ate. It then resembled in taste
and nourishment an Irish potato peeling. We
lived in this way for nearly fifty days, traveling
from Grand River across the divide to Green
River, and over the first range of the Wahsach
Mountains, on foot, Col. Fremont at our head,
tramping a pathway for his men to follow. He,
as well as the rest of the party, towards the
last was entirely barefoot&mdash;some of them had
a piece of raw hide on their feet, which, however,
becoming hard and stiff by the frost,
made them more uncomfortable than walking
without any.</p>

<p>"Yesterday, Mr. Oliver Fuller, of St. Louis,
who had been on foot for some weeks, suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
gave out. Our engineers and myself were with
him. He found himself unable to proceed&mdash;the
snow was very deep, and his feet were
badly frozen. He insisted that we should leave
him, and hasten to camp for relief; not being
able to render him any assistance by remaining,
we wrapped his blankets around him and
left him on the trail. In vain we searched for
material to build him a fire&mdash;nothing was
visible but a wild waste of snow; we were also
badly crippled, and we did not arrive in camp
until ten o'clock at night, at which time it began
snowing furiously. We told Col. Fremont of
Mr. Fuller's situation, when he sent a Mexican
named Frank, with the two best animals and
cooked horsemeat, to bring Mr. Fuller in.
There was not a dry eye in the whole camp
that night&mdash;the men sat up anxiously awaiting
the return of our companions.</p>

<p>"At daylight, they being still out, Col. Fremont
sent three Delawares mounted, to look
for them. About ten o'clock one of them returned
with the Mexican and two mules.
Frank was badly frozen, he had lost the track,
and bewildered and cold, he sank down holding
on to the animals, where he was found by
the Delaware during the afternoon. The two
Delawares supporting Mr. Fuller were seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
approaching. He was found awake, but almost
dead from the cold and faintness. Col. Fremont
personally rendered him all the assistance
in his power. So did all of us&mdash;for he
was beloved and respected by the whole camp
for his gentlemanly behavior and his many
virtues. Col. Fremont remained at this dreary
place near three days, to allow poor Fuller
time to recruit&mdash;and afterwards assigned to
him the best mule to carry him, while two of
the men walked on either side to support him.
A portion of our scanty food was appropriated
at every meal from each man's portion to make
Mr. Fuller's larger, as he required sustenance
more than they did.</p>

<p>"On the 7th February, almost in sight of
succor, the Almighty took him to himself: he
died on horseback&mdash;his two companions
wrapped him in his India rubber blanket and
laid him across the trail. We arrived next
day at Parawan. After the men had rested a
little, we went in company with three or four
of the inhabitants of Parawan, to bury our
deceased friend. His remains had not been
disturbed during our absence."</p>

<p>In the month of February, and soon after
Fremont's arrival and departure, Col. Beale
again solicited Carson to be his guide while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
paid a visit to a large village of Indians congregated
on the Arkansas, for the purpose of
carrying out a stipulation of the treaty with
Mexico, that the captives the Indians retained
in the territory ceded to the United States,
should be returned to Mexico. He found four
tribes congregated, to the number of two thousand,
for the purpose of meeting their agent,
an experienced mountaineer, who informed
Col. Beale that it would be useless to attempt
to enforce the provisions of the treaty here,
especially when so many Indians were together,
and succeeded in persuading him to desist from
the use of force against them.</p>

<p>These Indians had been accustomed to dealing
with poorly clad Mexican soldiers, and the
sight and bearing of Col. Beale and Carson and
the men under their command, must have induced
a respect for the government they represented,
so that they did not consider the expedition
as without good result.</p>

<p>The Camanche Indians could not well have
been induced to fulfill the provisions of the
treaty with Mexico, especially as they were not
a party to it, for in the very many years past,
it had been their custom to make incursions
upon the Mexican settlements and parties of
travelers, and to capture their cattle and take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
their goods, besides bringing away as many
children as possible, in order that the girls procured
in this way should, when grown, marry
the braves of the tribe; till now at least a third
of the blood of the tribe was Mexican. This
amalgamation had become more extensive in
this than in any of the other New Mexican
tribes.</p>

<p>The Apache is smaller in stature and more
closely built than the Camanche; less skilled
in horsemanship, but equally brave, with
beautiful symmetry of form, and "muscles as
hard as iron," with an elasticity of movement
that shows a great amount of physical training,
and an eye that reveals the treachery of
their character.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>

<p>Arriving again in Taos, to carry into effect
at once, the resolution he had formed of establishing
for himself a permanent home, he
joined his old friend Maxwell in the purpose
of occupying a beautifully romantic mountain
valley, fifty miles east of Taos, called by the
Indians Rayedo, which would long since have
been settled by the Mexicans, only it was very
much exposed to Indian depredations.</p>

<p>Through the centre of this valley flows a
broad mountain stream, and, for the loveliness
of the scenery, or the fertility of its broad,
sloping basin, or the mountain supply of timber,
there can scarcely be found a spot to equal
it. Carson and Maxwell established a settlement
about mid-way in the valley; and at the
present date, have an imposing little village,
in which the houses of Carson and Maxwell
are prominent by reason of their greater dimensions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
and indicate to the trader a style
of plenteous comfort, which, while it might
offend the pale-faced denizen of our most fashionable
thoroughfares, the traveler, who has
learned to love nature and health, gazes upon
with pleasure, and gladly tarries to enjoy the
patriarchal hospitality, and the sumptuous,
almost regal luxury of their hunter occupants,
who "count their horses and their cattle by
the hundreds," and whose thousand sheep are
on the hills; whose larder is replenished from
the still countless herds of prairie oxen which
roam through those magnificent plains, and
the lesser bands of speed-defying, beauteous
quadrupeds of the hills, and the fleet climbers
of the rocks and big-horned mountain cliffs,
and the flocks that build their eyrie in their
crags, all of which are occupants of the sheep-pasture
of these chevaliers of the wilderness,
and in whose court-yards may be seen specimens
of this game, of which they are not
ashamed; for a young Carson has lassoed a
little grizzly, while antelope and young fawn
feed from his sister's fingers.</p>

<p>Here too the Indian braves fear not to come
and call the master of the mansion, Father,&mdash;"Father
Kit," is his long time appellation&mdash;and
they have learned to look on him and his,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
with all that reverence and fondness with
which grateful children look upon a worthy
sire.</p>

<p>Carson cannot tarry at his pleasant home,
much more than to care for its necessary superintendence,
for his life is the property of the
public; and to the quiet settlement of the Indians
into the condition which is happiest for
them, so far as it can be secured in the condition
of the country and their own habitudes, is
the work to which he has wisely devoted himself.
He has given to the Indians the best
years of his ever busy life, and gives them
still, neglectful of immediate personal comfort&mdash;or
rather finding highest satisfaction in
doing what is fittest he should do, because it is
the work in which he can accomplish the most
good.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of the home of Carson, and
that of his friend Maxwell, are gathered a
number of their old comrades&mdash;men of the
mountains, who have survived the multitudinous
and conflicting events which have come
over the spirit of the Yankee, and the activities
of the Yankee nation, since the business of
trapping first became for her hardy sons a lucrative
employment; and here, in the society of
each other, and the conscious security of protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
for each other, in a locality congenial to
their tastes, with occasional old time occupations,
and where the rivalries of their predilections
can be still indulged, and quietly maintained,
they are ever ready after every test to
concede to Christopher Carson the palm of
being <i>first</i> as a hunter, <i>first</i> as an experienced
traveler and guide through the mountain country,
whether it be by a route he has, or one he
has never before traveled.</p>

<p>The stories of his exploits in defence of his
neighbors and friends, and to recover from the
Indians property they had stolen, since he left
the service of the Army of the United States,
would of themselves fill a volume, and we
have space to allude to but a very few.</p>

<p>A Mrs. White, the wife of a merchant of
Santa Fe, had been taken captive with her
child, (which was soon killed before her eyes,)
by a party of Apaches, who had shot her husband,
and all the men of his company, before
capturing her. A party of New Mexicans was
at once organized to pursue the Indian band,
and effect Mrs. White's release if possible.
The guidance of this party was entrusted to
a neighbor by the name of Watkins Leroux,
rather than to Carson. They found the Apache
murderers, and Carson was advancing foremost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
to attack them, when he discovered that
the rest of the party were not following; consequently
he had to retire, and when the commander
ordered the attack to be made, it was
too late, for the Indians had murdered Mrs.
White and were preparing to escape by flight.
Carson tells this story with all the generous
magnanimity a great soul exercises in speaking
of a failure on the part of a rival; admitting
that, if his advice had been followed, they
might have saved Mrs. White, but affirming
that the command "did what seemed to it the
best, and therefore no one has any right to
find fault."</p>

<p>This occurred in the autumn of eighteen
hundred and forty-nine, directly after the commencement
of the settlement of Rayedo.</p>

<p>Near the close of the following winter, all
the animals belonging to the party of ten dragoons
which had been stationed there to protect
the settlement, were run off by the marauding
Apaches, and the two herders having
them in charge, were wounded. Early the following
morning, Carson and three of the settlers
with the ten dragoons, started in pursuit,
discovered the Indians&mdash;twenty well armed
warriors&mdash;and four of the party being obliged
to stop, because their animals had given out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
the remaining ten rode down the Indians,
who might themselves have escaped but for
their persistance in retaining the stolen horses,
which were all recaptured except four, while
five of the warriors were killed, and several
more wounded. This expedition was planned
and executed under the direction of Carson, and
the fact that he was their leader gave every
man confidence, as they knew that with him an
engagement implied success or death.</p>

<p>The next spring Carson went to Fort Laramie
with a drove of horses and mules, making the
journey successfully and pleasantly in company
with Timothy Goodell, another old mountaineer,
being the observed of all observers to
the large numbers of overland emigrants to
California whom he met at the fort, where
Goodell left him to go to California.</p>

<p>Carson found a Mexican to attend him upon
his return, and taking a circuitous course, he
managed to avoid the Apaches; often traveling
by moon-light, and taking their animals into a
quiet nook, and climbing a tree for a little
sleep during the day, they finally reached the
Mexican settlements in safety.</p>

<p>The days of the following summer winged
their happy flight with great rapidity, while
Carson was directing and aiding in his farming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
and, of course, pursuing his favorite employment
of hunting, ever returning from a
hunt with his horse laden with deer or antelope,
wild turkey and ducks, or perhaps a half
score or more of prairie chickens, to complete
the list. Only once was his work interrupted
by the harsher business of chastising offenders
against justice, and this time the guilty parties
were two white men.</p>

<p>A party of desperadoes, so frequently the
nuisance of a new country, had formed a plot
to murder and rob two wealthy citizens, whom
they had volunteered to accompany to the settlements
in the States, and were already many
miles on their way, when Carson was informed
of the nefarious design. In one hour he had
organized a party, and was on his way in quick
pursuit, taking a more direct route to intercept
the party, and endeavoring at the same time to
avoid the vicinity of the Indians, who were
now especially hostile, but of whose movements
Carson was as well informed as any one
could be. In two days out from Taos, they
came upon a camp of United States recruits,
whose officer volunteered to accompany him with
twenty men, which offer was accepted, and by
forced marches they soon overtook the party
of traders, and at once arrested Fox, the leader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
of the wretches, and then proceeded to inform
Messrs. Brevoort and Weatherhead of the danger
which they had escaped; and they, though
at first astounded by the disclosure, had noticed
many things to convince them that the plot
would soon have been put in execution.</p>

<p>Taking the members of their party whom
they knew were trusty, they at once ordered
the rest, thirty-five in number, to leave immediately,
except Fox, who remained in charge
of Carson, to whom the traders were abundant
in their thanks for his timely interference in
their behalf, and who refused every offer of
recompense.</p>

<p>Fox was taken to Taos, and imprisoned for
a number of months; but as a crime only in
intent was difficult to be proved, and the <i>adobe</i>
walls of their houses were not secure enough to
retain one who cared to release himself, Fox
was at last liberated, and went to parts unknown.</p>

<p>On the return of Messrs. Brevoort and
Weatherhead from St. Louis, they presented
Carson with a magnificent pair of pistols, upon
whose silver mounting were inscribed such
words as would laconically illustrate his noble
deed, and the appreciation of the donors of the
great service rendered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
The summer following was consumed in an
excursion for trade, on behalf of himself and
Maxwell, and a visit to the home of his daughter,
now married in St. Louis; and which was
prosecuted without incident worthy of note,
until he came to a Cheyenne village on the
Arkansas, upon his return. This village had
received an affront from the officer of a party
of United States troops bound to New Mexico,
who had whipped one of their chiefs, some ten
days before the arrival of Carson; and to have
revenge upon some one of the whites, was now
the passion of the whole tribe.</p>

<p>The conduct of this officer is only a specimen
of that which thousands have exercised toward
the Indians of the different tribes; and the
result is the same in all cases. Carson's was
the first party to pass the Indian village after
this insult; and so many years had elapsed
since he was a hunter at Bent's Fort, and so
much had this nation been stirred by their
numberless grievances, that Carson's name was
no longer a talisman of safety to his party, nor
even of respect to himself, in their then state
of excitement; and as Carson went deliberately
into the war council, which the Indians were
holding on the discovery of his party, having
ordered his men to keep their force close together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
the Indians supposing he could not
understand them, continued to talk freely of
the manner of capturing the effects, and killing
the whole party, and especially himself, whom
they at once concluded was the leader. When
Kit had heard all their plans, he coolly addressed
them in the Cheyenne language, telling
them who he was, his former association with
and kindness to their tribe; and that now, he
should be glad to render them any assistance
they might need; but as to their having his
scalp, he should claim the right of saying a
word. The Indians departed, and Carson went
on his way; but there were hundreds of the
Cheyennes in sight upon the hills, and though
they made no attack, Carson knew he was in
their power, nor had they given up the idea of
taking his train. His cool deliberation kept
his men in spirits, and yet, except upon two or
three of the whole fifteen, he could place no
reliance in an emergency. At night the men
and mules were all brought within the circle
of wagons, grass was cut with their sheath-knives,
and brought into the mules, and as
large a guard was placed as possible. When
all was quiet, Carson called outside the camp
with him a Mexican boy of the party, and explaining
to him the danger which threatened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
them, told him it was in his power to save the
lives of the company, and giving him instructions
how to proceed, sent him on alone to
Rayedo, a journey of nearly three hundred
miles, to ask an escort of United States troops
to be sent out to meet him, telling the brave
young Mexican to "put a good many miles
between him and the camp before morning;"
and so he started him, with a few rations of
provisions, without telling the rest of the party
that such a step was necessary. This boy had
long been in Carson's service, and was well
known to him as faithful and active, so that he
had no doubts as to the faithful execution of
the trust confided to him; and in a wild country
like New Mexico, with the out-door life
and habits of its people, a journey like the one
on which he was dispatched, was not an unusual
occurrence: indeed, in that country, parties on
foot often accompany those on horse, for days
together, and do not seem to feel the fatigue.
Carson now returned to the camp to watch
all night himself; and at break of day they
were again upon the road. No Indians appeared
until nearly noon, when five warriors
came galloping toward them. As they came
near enough to hear him, Carson ordered them
to halt, and approaching, told them that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
night before, he had sent a messenger to
Rayedo, to inform the troops that their tribe
were annoying him; and if he or his men were
molested, terrible punishment would be inflicted
by those who would surely come to his
relief. The Indians replied, that they would
look for the moccasin tracks, which they probably
found, and Carson considered this the
reason that induced the whole village to pass
away toward the hills after a little time, evidently
seeking a place of safety. The young
Mexican overtook the party of troops whose
officer had caused the trouble, to whom he told
his story, and failing to secure sympathy, he
continued to Rayedo, and procured thence immediate
assistance. Major Grier dispatched a
party of troops, under Lieutenant R. Johnston,
which, making rapid marches, met Carson
twenty-five miles below Bent's Fort; and,
though they encountered no Indians, the effect
of the quick transit of troops from one part of
the country to another, could not be other than
good, as a means of impressing the Indians
with the effective force of the United States
troops.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>

<p>Eighteen years had elapsed, full of eventful
history&mdash;especially the last ten&mdash;since Carson
had renounced the business of trapping, and
of late there had been an almost irrepressible
longing once more to try his skill at his old
employment, in company with others who had
been, with himself, adepts at the business.
Accordingly he and Maxwell, by a great effort,
succeeded in collecting sixteen more of their
old companions, and taking care to provide
themselves abundantly with all the necessaries
for such a service, and with such added articles
of comfort as the pleasurable character of the
excursion dictated, they started, with Carson at
the head of the band, "any one of whom would
have periled his life for any other, and having
voted that the expedition should be one for hard
work, as when they trapped for gain long ago,"
they dashed on across the plains, till they came
to the South Platte, and upon its well remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
waters, formed their camp and set their
traps, having first apprised themselves, by the
"signs," that the beaver were abundant. Indeed,
so long ago had trapping gone into disuse,
that the hunt proved successful beyond their
anticipations, and they worked down this
stream, through the Laramie plains to the
New Park, on to the Old Park, and upon a
large number of the streams, their old resorts,
and returned to Rayedo with a large stock of
furs, having enlivened the time by the recital
to each other of many of the numberless entertaining
events which had crowded upon their
lives while they had been separated.</p>

<p>Would not the reader like to have made
this excursion with them, and witnessed the
infinite zest with which these mature and experienced
men entered again upon what seemed
now to them the sport of their earlier years?
They made it, as much as possible, a season of
enjoyment. One of the party had lassoed a
grizzly, but, finding it inconvenient to retain
him, he had been shot, and bear steaks, again
enjoyed together, had been a part of the
Fourth of July treat they afforded their visitors,
the Sioux Indians. As we have but little
further opportunity, we will quote Fremont's
description of the Mountain Parks, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
sake of giving the reader an idea of the locality
of this last trapping enterprise of Kit Carson:</p>

<p>"Our course in the afternoon brought us to
the main Platte River, here a handsome stream,
with a uniform breadth of seventy yards, except
where widened by frequent islands. It
was apparently deep, with a moderate current,
and wooded with groves of large willow.</p>

<p>"The valley narrowed as we ascended, and
presently degenerated into a gorge, through
which the river passed as through a gate. We
entered it, and found ourselves in the New
Park&mdash;a beautiful circular valley of thirty miles
diameter, walled in all round with snowy
mountains, rich with water and with grass,
fringed with pine on the mountain sides below
the snow line, and a paradise to all grazing
animals. The Indian name for it signifies
"<i>cow lodge</i>," of which our own may be considered
a translation; the enclosure, the grass, the
water, and the herds of buffalo roaming over
it, naturally presenting the idea of a park,
7,720 feet above tide water.</p>

<p>"It is from this elevated <i>cove</i>, and from the
gorges of the surrounding mountains, and some
lakes within their bosoms, that the Great Platte
River collects its first waters, and assumes its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
first form; and certainly no river has a more
beautiful origin.</p>

<p>"Descending from the pass, we found ourselves
again on the western waters; and halted
to noon on the edge of another mountain valley,
called the Old Park, in which is formed
Grand River, one of the principal branches
of the Colorado of California. We were now
moving with some caution, as, from the trail,
we found the Arapahoe village had also passed
this way. As we were coming out of their
enemy's country, and this was a war ground,
we were desirous to avoid them. After a long
afternoon's march, we halted at night on a
small creek, tributary to a main fork of Grand
River, which ran through this portion of the
valley. The appearance of the country in the
Old Park is interesting, though of a different
character from the New; instead of being a
comparative plain, it is more or less broken
into hills, and surrounded by the high mountains,
timbered on the lower parts with quaking
asp and pines.</p>

<p>"We entered the Bayou Salade, (South
Park,) and immediately below us was a green
valley, through which ran a stream; and a
short distance opposite rose snowy mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
whose summits were formed into peaks of
naked rock.</p>

<p>"On the following day we descended the
stream by an excellent buffalo trail, along the
open grassy bottom of the river. On our
right, the bayou was bordered by a mountainous
range, crested with rocky and naked peaks;
and below it had a beautiful park-like character
of pretty level prairies, interspersed
among low spurs, wooded openly with pine
and quaking asp, contrasting well with the
denser pines which swept around on the mountain
sides.</p>

<p>"During the afternoon, Pike's Peak had
been plainly in view before us.</p>

<p>"The next day we left the river, which continued
its course towards Pike's Peak; and
taking a south-easterly direction, in about ten
miles we crossed a gentle ridge, and, issuing
from the South Park, found ourselves involved
among the broken spurs of the mountains
which border the great prairie plains. Although
broken and extremely rugged, the
country was very interesting, being well watered
by numerous affluents to the Arkansas
River, and covered with grass and a variety
of trees."</p>

<p>Carson had disposed of his furs, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
again quietly attending to his ranche, when he
heard of the exorbitant prices for which sheep
were selling in California, and determined to
enter upon a speculation. He had already visited
the Navajos Indians, and thither he went
again, and in company with Maxwell and another
mountaineer, purchased several thousand
sheep; and with a suitable company of trusty
men as shepherds, took them to Fort Laramie,
and thence by the regular emigrant route, past
Salt Lake to California, and arriving without
any disaster, disposed of them in one of the
frontier towns, and then went down to the Sacramento
valley, to witness the change which
had come over old familiar places; not that
the mining did not interest him; he had seen
that before in Mexico, but he had not seen the
cities which had sprung into existence at a
hundred points, in the foot hills of the Sierras,
nor had he seen San Francisco, that city of
wondrous growth, which now contained thirty-five
thousand inhabitants.</p>

<p>But for the remembrance of the hills on
which the city rested, Carson would not have
known the metropolis of California, as the spot
where in '48 "the people could be counted in an
hour." In San Francisco he met so many old
friends, and so many, who, knowing him from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
the history of his deeds, desired to do him
honor, that the attentions he received, while it
gratified his ambition, were almost annoying.</p>

<p>Tired by the anxiety and hard work of
bringing his property over a long and dangerous
journey to a good market, he had
looked for rest and retirement; but instead, he
was everywhere sought out and made conspicuous.</p>

<p>He found himself surrounded with the
choice spirits of the new El Dorado; his name
a prestige of strength and position, and his society
courted by everybody. The siren voice
of pleasure failed not to speak in his ear her
most flattering invitations. Good-fellowship
took him incessantly by the hand, desiring to
lead him into the paths of dissipation. But
the gay vortex, with all its brilliancy, had no
attractions for him; the wine cup, with its
sparkling arguments, failed to convince his
calm earnestness of character, that his simple
habits of life needed remodeling. To the storm,
however, he was exposed; but, like a good ship
during the gale, he weathered the fierce blast,
and finally took his departure from the new
city of a day, with his character untarnished,
but nevertheless leaving behind him many
golden opinions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Some newspaper scribbler, last autumn, announced
the death of Carson, and said, in connection,
"His latest and <i>most remarkable exploit</i>
on the plains, was enacted in 1853, when
he conducted a drove of sheep safely to California."
Probably the writer was one of those
whose eager curiosity had met a rebuff, in the
quiet dignity with which Carson received the
officiousness of the rabble who thronged around
him on that visit. Not that he appreciated
honor less, but that its unnecessary attachments
were exceedingly displeasing to him.</p>

<p>In this terribly fast city, where the <i>monte</i>
table, and its kindred dissipations, advertised
themselves without a curtain, and where to indulge
was the rule rather than the exception,
Carson was able to stand fire, for he had been
before now tried by much greater temptations.</p>

<p>In the strange commingling of people from
all quarters of the globe, whom Carson witnessed
in San Francisco, he saw but a slight
exaggeration of what he had often witnessed
in Santa Fe,&mdash;and indeed, for the element of
variety, in many a trapping party, not to name
the summer rendezvous of the trappers, or the
exploring parties of Col. Fremont. To be
sure the Chinamen and the Kanackers were a
new feature in society. But whether it be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
the many nationalities represented, or in the
pleasures they pursued, except that in San
Francisco there was a lavishness in the expenditure
of wealth commensurate with its
speedier accumulation, there was little new to
him, and while he saw its magic growth with
glad surprise, the attractions this city offered
could not allure him. Nor could the vista it
opened up of a chance to rise into position in
the advancing struggles for political ascendency,
induce one wish to locate his home in a
spot so wanting in the kindly social relationships;
for he had tried the things and found
them vanity and vexation of spirit, and now
he yearned for his mountain home, and the
sweet pastoral life which it afforded in his circle
of tried friends.</p>

<p>He saved the money he had secured by the
sale of his flocks, and went down overland to
Los Angelos to meet Maxwell, who took the
trip by sea, which Carson having tasted once,
could not be persuaded to try again, and there
renewing his outfit, and visiting again some of
its honored citizens, they started homeward,
and had a pleasant passage till they reached
the Gila River, where grass became so scarce
that they were compelled to take a new course
in order to find food for their horses; but Carson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
had no difficulty in pursuing a measurably
direct course, and without encountering a snow
storm, often terribly severe in the mountains
of this interior country, he reached Taos on
the third of December 1853.</p>

<p>He here received the unexpected information
that he had been appointed Indian agent for
New Mexico, and immediately wrote and sent
to Washington the bonds of acceptance of this
office. And now commences Carson's official
career, in a capacity for which he was better
fitted than any other person in the Territory.</p>

<p>Long had the Indians in his vicinity called
him "father," but now he had a new claim to
this title, for he was to be to them the almoner
of the bounty of the United States Government.
There was immediate call for the exercise
of the duties of his office, (for the Indians
of New Mexico had all buried the tomahawk
and calumet,) in visiting and attempting to
quiet a band of Apaches, among whom he
went alone, for they all knew him, and secured
from them plenty of promises to do well; but
he had scarcely left them, before they were
tired of the self-imposed restraint, and renewedly
continued their depredations, and several
serious battles were fought with them by the
United States troops, the first having proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
unsuccessful, but never was success wanting
when the commander of United States dragoons
had placed his confidence in the advice, and followed
the suggestions of Kit Carson, who was
admitted by them to be the prince of Indian
fighters&mdash;though he never tolerated cruelty or
the expenditure of life when there was no imperious
necessity, but yet regarded severe
measures better than a dawdling policy.</p>

<p>There had been serious fights in New Mexico
in 1846, while Carson was away with Fremont;
and it was better so, as the Mexicans
were his blood and kin; yet, in the change of
authority, he fully sympathized. But now, the
enemy was the different tribes of Indians, and
in the capacity of Agent for them, Carson
chose to impress them with the power of the
government for which he acted for their own
good, that they might be induced to desist from
their plundering, and be prepared for the influences
and practices of civilization; and all
the victories secured over them were due, as
history truly records, "To the aid of Kit Carson,"
"With the advice of Kit Carson;" and
never once is his name associated with a defeat;
for, if he made a part of an expedition, a condition
must be, that such means should be employed
as he knew would accomplish the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
desired; for he did not choose, by one single
failure, to give the Indians a chance to think
their lawlessness could escape its merited retribution.</p>

<p>Nor yet did Carson ever advise that confidence
in the promises of the Indians which
was not backed by such exhibition of power as
to command obedience; knowing that with
these children of the forest, schooled in the
arts of plunder, and the belief that white men
and white men's property were an intrusion on
their hunting grounds, and therefore lawful
prey&mdash;this was and is <i>their law</i>&mdash;non-resistance
would not answer, and only stern command,
backed by the rifle, ever has secured obedience&mdash;though
they appreciate the kindnesses
done by those friends who have such reliance.
But it was Carson's opinion that the country
cannot be safe while the Indians roam over it
in this wild way, or until they are located on
lands devoted to them and theirs for permanent
homes, and are compelled to settle upon and
cultivate the soil, when he thinks they will
come, by careful teaching, to display sentiments
of responsibility for their own acts.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that, had Carson been
appointed Superintendent of Indian Affairs for
the department of New Mexico, the reliance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
sometimes placed on treaties would have been
discarded, and measures taken at an earlier
date, to locate the Apaches and Camanches and
Utahs, which might have been accomplished
with less expenditure of blood and of treasure;
but he quietly pursued his business, relying upon
the influence which his knowledge and skill had
given him to induce his superiors in official
authority to undertake such measures as seemed
to him the wisest.</p>

<p>The headquarters of his Indian agency were
at Taos, and while he spent as much of his time
as possible at Rayedo, the duties of his office
compelled the larger part of it at Taos. The
thousand kindly acts he was able to perform for
the Indians, by whom he was constantly surrounded,
had secured such regard for himself
that he needed no protection where he was
known&mdash;and what Indian of New Mexico did
not know him? He went among them, and
entertained them as the children of his charge,
having their unbounded confidence and love.</p>

<p>Every year, in the hey-day of the season,
Carson continued the custom of a revival of
earlier associations, by indulging, for a few days,
or perhaps weeks, in the chase; and was joined
in these excursions by a goodly company of his
old compeers, as well as later acquired friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
and men of reputation and culture, from whatever
quarter of the world, visiting the territory;
and especially by a select few of the braves of
the Indian tribes under his charge. These were
seasons of grateful recurrence, and their pleasures
were long anticipated amid the wearisome duties
of his office.</p>

<p>The incidents of his every-day life, intervening
his appointment as Indian agent and the
rebellion, would furnish an abundance of material
for a romance even stranger than fiction. A life
so exciting as that among the Indians and brave
frontiersmen, and a name so renowned as that
of Christopher Carson, could not but attract
and concentre wild and romantic occurrences.
His life during these years is inseparably connected
with the history of the Territory of New
Mexico, which, could it be given to the public
in all its copious and interesting details, would
unquestionably concede to him all the noblest
characteristics in man.</p>

<p>The treaties between the United States and
the Indians, during the term of his appointment,
were mainly the result of his acquaintance with
the Indians, his knowledge of their character,
and his influence over them. Nor did the
Government fail to recognize his valuable services.
During the rebellion, and while serving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
principally in New Mexico, where he distinguished
himself by his untiring prosecution of
hostilities with his savage foes, then at war with
the Government, he was promoted from rank to
rank, until he finally reached that of Brevet
Brigadier-General.</p>

<p>In a report to the National headquarters,
dated at Camp Florilla, near Fort Canby, N. M.,
January 26, 1864, we find the following detailed
account of operations in New Mexico:</p>

<p>"The culminating point in this expedition has
been reached at last by the very successful
operations of our troops at Cañon de Chelly.
Col. Kit Carson left Fort Canby on the sixth
instant with a command of four hundred men,
twenty of whom were mounted. He had a
section of mountain artillery with him, and
taking the road <i>via</i> Puebla, Colorado, he started
for Cañon de Chelly. He gave orders to Capt.
Pheiffer with his command of one hundred men
to enter the cañon at the east opening, while he
himself intended to enter it at the 'mouth,' or
west opening, and by this movement he expected
that both columns would meet in the
cañon on the second day, as it was supposed to
be forty miles in length.</p>

<p>"Capt. Pheiffer's party proceeded two days
through the cañon, fighting occasionally; but although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
the Indians frequently fired on them from
the rocky walls above, the balls were spent long before
they reached the bottom of the cañon, which,
in many places, exceeded one thousand five
hundred feet in depth. It was a singular spectacle
to behold. A small detachment of troops
moving cautiously along the bottom of one of
the greatest cañons on the globe, (the largest is
in Asia, I believe,) and firing volleys upward at
hundreds of Navajoes, who looked, on the dizzy
height above them, like so many pigmies. As
they advanced the cañon widened in places, and
various spots of cultivated land were passed,
where wheat, maize, beans, melons, etc., had
been planted last year; while more than a
thousand feet above their heads they beheld
neat-looking stone houses built on the receding
ledges of rocks, which reminded the beholder of
the swallows' nests in the house eaves, or on the
rocky formation overhanging the 'sea-beat caves.'
Further on, an orchard containing about six hundred
peach-trees was passed, and it was evident
that the Indians had paid great attention to their
culture.</p>

<p>"On the second day a party from Col. Carson's
column met the Captain in the cañon, and returned
with him to Col. Carson's camp. A
party from the Colonel's command had, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
meantime, attacked a party of Indians, twenty-two
of whom were killed. This had a dispiriting
effect on many others, who sent in three
of their number under a white flag. Col. Carson
received them, and assured them that the Government
did not desire to exterminate them, but
that, on the contrary, the President wished to
save and civilize them; and to that end Gen.
Carlton had given him instructions to send all
the Navajoes who desired peace to the new
reservation on the Rio Pecos, where they would
be supplied with food for the present, and be
furnished with implements, seeds, etc., to cultivate
the soil. They departed well-satisfied, and
Col. Carson immediately ordered Capt. A. B.
Carey, Thirteenth United States Infantry, with
a battalion to enter the cañon, and make a
thorough exploration of its various branches,
and at the same time to be in readiness to
chastise any body of hostile Navajoes he might
encounter, and to receive all who were friendly,
and who wished to emigrate to the new reservation.
Capt. Carey, during a passage of twenty-four
hours through a branch of the cañon hitherto
unexplored, made an exact geographical map
of this terrible chasm, and discovered many side
cañons hitherto unknown. About one hundred
Indians came in to him and declared that 'the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Navajo nation was no more;' that they were
tired of fighting and nearly starved, and that
they wished to be permitted to advise their
friends and families in the mountains; many of
whom were willing to leave the land forever,
and go to a country where they would be cared
for and protected. They said they understood
agriculture, and were certain they would make
comfortable homes on the Pecos. This was, of
course, only the opinion of some; others would
prefer to remain and culture the soil on which
they were born, and live at peace with the
territory. However, the latter were positively
informed that unless they were willing to
remove they had better not come in, and,
moreover, that the troops would destroy every
blade of corn in the country next summer.</p>

<p>"On the 20th of January Col. Carson came
to Fort Canby, and about six hundred Indians
had collected there; but when the wagons arrived
to remove them only one hundred wished to go,
and the remainder desired to return to their
villages and caves in the mountains, on pretence
of bringing in some absent member of their
families. Col. Carson very nobly and generously
permitted them to choose for themselves; but
told them if ever they came in again they should
be sent to Borgue Redondo, whether willing or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
not. Col. Carson himself took the Indians to
Santa Fe, and will remain absent about a month.
Since his departure many Indians came in and
agreed to go to the reservation.</p>

<p>"I think the Colonel foresaw this, as no
person understands Indian character better than
he does. Capt. A. B. Carey, Thirteenth Infantry,
commanding in his absence, will see that
all Indians coming in will be removed, and, I
think, before April next, if the present good
feeling exists, we shall have accomplished the
removal of the entire tribe. Capt. A. B. Carey,
after successfully marching through the cañon
and noting its topography, reached Fort Canby
on the eighteenth instant, and relieved Capt.
Francis M'Cabe, First New Mexico Cavalry,
who commanded in the absence of Col. Kit
Carson.</p>

<p>"As the Navajo expedition is now entirely
successful, it is but justice to the officers and
men of the First Cavalry of New Mexico, and
to Col. Christopher Carson and his staff to say
that they have all acted with zeal and devotion
for the accomplishment of that great desideratum&mdash;the
removal of the Navajoes. Cut off
from the enjoyments of civilized life, deprived
of its luxuries, comforts, and even many of its
necessaries, and restricted to the exploration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
a wilderness and the castigation of an army of
savages, who defied them, and endeavored to
find a shelter among the cliffs, groves, and
cañons of their country; in pursuing them to
their haunts they have encountered appalling
difficulties, namely: want of water, grass, and
fuel; often exposed to the merciless fury of the
elements, and to the bullets and arrows of a
hidden foe. In the face of these difficulties they
have discovered new rivers, springs, and mountains
in a region hitherto unexplored, and penetrated
by companies into the very strongholds
of the enemy, who fled farther west as our
columns advanced, and on various occasions the
dismounted cavalry have, by rapid and unparalleled
night marches, surprised that enemy,
capturing his camp and securing his flocks and
herds, at a time when he imagined himself far
beyond our reach, and really when he occupied
a country never before trodden by the foot of a
white man.</p>

<p>"Much of the credit is due to the perseverance
and courage of Col. Kit Carson, commanding the
expedition, whose example excited all to great
energy, and inspired great resolution; but it may
not be out of place to remark that it is now demonstrated
beyond a doubt that, while the troops
of New Mexico have long borne the reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
of being the best cavalry, they have proved
themselves in the present campaign to be the
best infantry in the world.</p>

<p>"Gen. James H. Carlton, who knows, perhaps,
and understands the material for an army as
well as any General in our army, has directed
the formation of a New-Mexican Brigade, and
when the savage foe is removed, that Brigade,
commanded by Brigadier-Gen. Kit Carson, would
surely reflect credit on the Territory and on the
Department Commander."</p>

<p>After the close of the war Christopher Carson
continued in the employ of the Government,
rendering such services as only one equally
skilled and experienced could render, until his
death. He died at Fort Lyon, Colorado, on the
23d of May, 1868, from the effects of the rupture
of an artery, or probably an aneurism of an
artery, in the neck. But a few weeks previous
he had visited Washington on a treaty mission,
in company with a deputation of red men, and
made a tour of several of the Northern and
Eastern cities.</p>

<p>In his death the country has lost the most
noted of that intrepid race of mountaineers,
trappers, and guides that have ever been the
pioneers of civilization in its advancement westward.
As an Indian fighter he was matchless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
His rifle, when fired at a redskin, never failed
him, and the number that fell beneath his aim,
who can tell! (The identical rifle which Carson
used in all his scouts, during the last thirty-five
years of his life, he bequeathed, just previous to
his death, to Montezuma Lodge, A. F. and A.
M., Santa Fe, of which he was a member.) The
country will always regard him as a perfect
representative of the American frontiersman,
and accord to him the most daring valor, consistent
kindliness, perseverant energy and truthfulness
which that whole great territory, that
we must still regard as lying between the civilizations,
is capable of furnishing.</p>
